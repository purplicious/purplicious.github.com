title: "Carrot Cupcakes Recipe"
---
<div>

Quantity: This recipe (VCTOTW) claims to make 24 cupcakes, but it actually makes only 16 if you fill them high enough to make them worth a damn. So, I need to tweak this recipe a bit (darn, more carrot cupcakes in my future). When I get it perfect, I'll replace this recipe with a better one.

Cake Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>1½ c flour</li>
	<li>1½ baking soda</li>
	<li>1 t baking powder</li>
	<li>½ t salt</li>
	<li>½ t cinnamon</li>
	<li>1/4 t nutmeg</li>
	<li>1/4 t ginger</li>
	<li>1 1/3 c sugar</li>
	<li>8 oz vanilla wholesoy yogurt</li>
	<li>2/3 c sunflower oil</li>
	<li>1 T vanilla extract</li>
	<li>2 c grated carrots (The recipe called for 1 cup, but my mommy always taught me when making carrot cake to double the amount of carrots it calls for because it makes them moister and healthier)</li>
	<li>1 c walnuts</li>
</ul>
Cake Directions

Sift together the first 7 dry ingredients in a large bowl.

In a mixing bowl, mix together sugar, oil, yogurt, and vanilla.

Add the dry ingredients to the wet slowly, and mix.

Add grated carrots and mix until evenly coated. Add walnuts.

Bake in a 350º oven for 24 minutes.

Icing Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>½ c margarine</li>
	<li>½ c tofutti</li>
	<li>2 t vanilla</li>
	<li>4 c powdered sugar</li>
</ul>
Icing Directions

Beat together the margarine, cream cheese, and vanilla extract.

Add the confectioner’s sugar, sifting it in, and then beat until smooth and fluffy.
