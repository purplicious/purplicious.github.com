These shoe clips are so ultra cute!!! Danielle made them and they're for sale in her new <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/70466997/cupcake-shoe-clips-free-shipping-pink" target="_blank">etsy store</a>. These make <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/2011/01/05/fun-a-day-5/">my cupcake shoe clips</a> look like a 5-year-old made them (or an adult who acts and dresses like a 5-year-old).
