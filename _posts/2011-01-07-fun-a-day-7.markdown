I'm soooo tired. After my 3 hour nap last night and then working all day, this wine glass charm was all I could muster up the energy for. While I was in the shower, I was pondering why this had to be the cupcake-a-day project that I am least happy with. Once upon a time, I was really good at shrinky dinks. I might even admit to being an expert at them.Â  Now, I seriously suck! This wine charm is kinda warped. Certainly not the flat, thick plastic that I remember shrinky dinks being. I'm going to sleep now and I hope that I don't have dreams about the cute wine charms in my cupboard making fun of the new subpar one. Tomorrow I'll make my cupcake extra cute to make up for this one.
