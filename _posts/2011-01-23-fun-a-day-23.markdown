Cupcake postcards are sooooooooooooooo cute! I kind of wish I had made a cupcake postcard for each day of the month, except that I don't think I'd have enough friends to send them all to. Pam would wonder why I wrote her 31 postcards. haha. This one is valentine's themed because I figure by the time the <a href="http://artclash.com/" target="_blank">art show</a> is over, it will be just in time for me to mail it to someone for valentine's day.
