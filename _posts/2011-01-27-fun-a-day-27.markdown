title: "Fun-a-day 27"

Cupcake-a-day #27 was the Saturday morning themed birthday party at work. I sent the email out yesterday letting everyone know that there would be breakfast served for lunch and that we could all wear our jammies to work. So, you can imagine my surprise when I arrived at work today to find that I was the only person wearing pajamas. Apparently, everyone thought I was just kidding. I mean I do have a very witty sense of humor, but it's not that good. I would also like to take this opportunity to point out that I park about a block away from work and that one block walk got me more stares than I ever thought possible. Apparently, Palo Alto doesn't see many people wearing footie pajamas in public. Anyway, included in breakfast today were the coffee cake cupcakes that Jessica and I made last night and I ate, not 1, not 2, but 3! Oink oink. I'm also excited to say that when I left for the day, there were still some left and I plan to eat more tomorrow. Woohoo!

The cupcake craft for today is a shower cap! I love shower caps! I only wash my hair every 10 days or so (unless that's weird, in which case I wash it every other day), so I am a firm believer in using shower caps on the non-hair-washing days. Guess what fabric today's shower cap is made out of?
