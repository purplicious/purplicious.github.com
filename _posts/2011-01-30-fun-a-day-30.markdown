So, during my working meeting with Jessica and Josipa (and the Philz barista) today, we discussed making business cards to bring to the art opening that's on Friday night at <a href="http://calendar.rpscollective.com/view_entry.php?id=1747&amp;date=20110205" target="_blank">Oakland Art Murmur</a>. It only made sense to use this as one of my cupcake-a-day projects and since I didn't have much time today, thanks to waking up after noon (I'm not lazy, we just didn't go to bed until 7am) and our poor welcoming of a Sunday afternoon by turning it into a workday, I figured today would be the perfect day to make a business card for the ieatcupcakes.com website, as well as the <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/ShojoPop" target="_blank">ShojoPop etsy store</a>. Many of the items made for this project are going to be sold on ShojoPop, but since they will all be on display for most of the month of February, they won't be sold until March. But I figured this way, if anyone sees something they must own, they can take a business card and find it later on etsy. So, here is the business card I just whipped up.
