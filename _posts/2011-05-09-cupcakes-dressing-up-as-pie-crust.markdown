title: "Cupcakes dressing up as pie crust"
---
There was a day that should have gone down in history, if only I could recall what day it was. Not important; like birthdays and anniversaries, we can just make up a day. Let's call this one May 1st and every May 1st from now on, we can celebrate the day when I successfully made something gluten-free that I didn't feel compelled to feed to the dog or the compost in an effort to hide my disastrous attempts. In this case, they would have had to go into the compost because they were chocolate cupcakes, which contrary to what Dexter may try to convince you of when you are in possession of anything chocolate and delicious, are not good for him. They are, however, good for me and my tummy. And not just my tummy, but also <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">my mouth. Wait, that wasn't what I meant...is it time for dessert? What I meant was that the cupcakes are also good</span> as a pie crust.

So, this all started when I thought it would be a great idea to volunteer my precious cupcake-baking, kiddo-entertaining, apron-sewing time as an assistant caterer for a dinner that was included as an auction item in the spring gala. Unlike other service-oriented donations I have been duped into donating in the past, this time the auction winner didn't forget about their purchase and actually wanted to cash it in--the gall of some people, right? So, one of my delegated jobs as assistant caterer was to make a gluten-free dessert.

Of course my plan was to make cupcakes, but that would be the decision of a freelance caterer, not a lowly assistant. I was given a specific menu of a chocolate espresso cheesecake because the dinner we catered had an italian theme. Well, if you had seen this cheesecake recipe they sent me, you'd have gone into cardiac arrest just from reading the list of cholesterol-filled ingredients. Veganizing the cheesecake recipe was easy-peasy, thanks to my amazing friend Melissa, who was kind enough to share her super-top-secret-she-would-take-my-first-born-if-I-ever-shared-it-with-anyone-recipe.

The hard part was how to make the chocolate crust gluten-free. This would likely be easy for many people who are not me, but I am not a gluten-free individual by any means. I like gluten. Sometimes I will eat an entire meal made mainly out of protein-rich glutenous morsels of deep-fried yumminess (fried seitan nuggets, I love you).  So, I decided to consult with an expert. Babycakes. If you are unfamiliar with Babycakes, you can either go to New York, or you can watch this <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/2009/09/30/babycakes-should-use-this-video-to-recruit-employees/">adorable video</a> that I posted on my blog a year or so ago.

Luckily, Sandy, the gala auction queen bee has been so busy running the gala auction that she hasn't needed her babycakes cookbook so she loaned it to me for an entire month! And it couldn't have come at a more perfect time because apparently, gluten-free pie crust is as easy as mashing up gluten-free cupcakes and pressing them into the bottom of a well-oiled springform pan lined with parchment paper. Viola.

I got many many compliments on the dessert and since the crust only used 5 cupcakes, we still had 7 to eat! And we actually wanted to eat them, not put them in the compost or feed them to the homeless (there's only one homeless person in Sunnyvale anyway and we don't want her to get fat). Here's <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/allergen-free-cupcakes/">the recipe</a>.
