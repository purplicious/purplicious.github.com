title: "Vegan Bakesale in SF"
---
<p style="text-align: center;">In preparation for Saturday's vegan bakesale, Pamela came over Friday night to begin our creation.  We photographed the process for your viewing enjoyment.  Here is step 1: the naked cupcakes before they were iced (which is basically a boring muffin).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-58" title="Before Icing" src="http://ieatcupcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/nofrosting1.jpg" alt="Before Icing" width="360" height="480" /></p>

Step 2 consisted of icing them.  I iced most of them while Pam made the fondant.

This is Pamela expertly kneading the fondant (she's an expert because she's like that chick from heroes who learns everything just by seeing someone else do it).  That was right before she added a half a bottle of black food dye. Yes, in case you were wondering, a half a bottle is the exact amount necessary.  Here's the finished product:

<p>Yes, those are cupcakes on her apron!  Cuter than my polka dot apron with lace trim and the heart pocket.  I didn't think it was possible.  I think my cupcakes might have sold the fastest due to their cute factor.</p>

<p>The entire bakesale had to end at 2:30 (instead of 4pm, as planned) because they ran out of baked goods!  I blame Matt for buying an entire box of yummies, trying to overcompensate for the fact that they didn't have a lemonade stand.  Someone made these cute star shaped brownies that I, of course, had to make Pam share one of with me because they were too cute for words.  And they were chocolate with chocolate chips.  Life doesn't really get better than double chocolate......well, unless it's triple chocolate ;)  Here are 2 flickr links and a link to Laura's (Vegansaurus) blog about the event:</p>

Thank you Pamela for helping me all weekend with this wonderful adventure.  We were afraid we wouldn't get to eat any of our magnificent creations, but since Robert didn't want his, we got to keep them all for ourselves and be piggies (like the cute piggy you can make in google chat).  On another side note, that night after bar #2 but before afterparty #1, we met Avi's friends who were visiting from Sacramento and one of them happened to be wearing a cupcake shirt from a place in Berlin that sells vegan cupcakes.  Ever been there?
