title: "Embarassing pictures day"
---
So, for some reason, unbeknownst to me, the girls at my work enjoy any and all conversations and activities having to do with things I do not like to disclose about myself. These include age, childhood stories, and embarassing moments. Therefore, it should not have come as any surprise when the party planning committee (PPC) at work chose the theme for the October birthday celebration of "bring the most awkward photos from your middle school days to work for everyone to not only, point, laugh, and ridicule, but also vote. As you can imagine, winning the most votes in this competition was not at all like winning something cool, like a cupcake baking competition or a marathon. It was closer to a reverse beauty pageant (aka. Ugly duckling contest).

What flavor cupcake goes best with humility? Yep, you guessed it! Peanut Butter Cupcakes with Chocolate Ganache.
