Emily's first question when she walks in the door, "Why aren't we making cupcakes?" Little miss self-proclaimed most non-domestic friend I have wanted to know why we weren't putting on our aprons and playing Betty Crocker this evening. Go figure. My response? Because we're making gift card holders. As I explained to Emily, I have a bundle of gift cards in my purse that are being held in place by a rubber band. I wish I could say that I am so popular around the holidays that I received all of these as gifts, but sadly, I had to buy them for myself. Why would anyone buy gift cards for themselves, unless it was some crazy deal like the one Bloomspot is having right now? I bought not only to make myself feel loved, but also to support Zen and Isabelle's school fundraiser.* I feel extremely ghetto when using any of my gift cards and sometimes notice myself trying to get my gift card out of my purse without anyone in public noticing this rubber band method because honestly, it's rather embarrassing, non-cute, and doesn't make my heart go pitter-patter. There seems no point in having things that do not fall into that latter category, so lo and behold, all gift cards now have a real (and cute) home. Let's hope it's a permanent adoption and this home can hold up to the abuse my purse can dole out because otherwise my foster children will be looking for another home at some point in the future. Nobody wants to be a foster child.
