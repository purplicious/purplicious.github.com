title: "Ode to Maggie Mudd"

These <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/mint-cookies-n-cream-cupcakes/">vegan mint cookies n cream cupcakes</a> are a Robin and Isabelle rendition of the cookies n cream cupcake recipe in Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World (VCTOTW). Â For those of you who had the pleasure of visiting Maggie Mudd before they decided to break the hearts of vegans all over the world (well, maybe just in the San Francisco bay area), you may know why the vegan mint cookies n cream ice cream flavor would entice someone to make a cupcake version of it. It's basically amazing. And luckily, Colby had a birthday recently, and the exquisite Katie got him the raddest World of Warcraft ice cream cake ever from Maggie Mudd (yes, they haven't completely sold us out...they are still offering ridiculously priced vegan ice cream cakes for you die-hard fans out there)! Instead of going into the details of the cake design being a timeline of all of Colby's current and past WOW characters, I will instead describe the deliciousness that is the mint cookies n cream ice cream that was enveloped by a brownie crust and the most delicious whipped topping icing I have ever experienced (I must get more info on this stuff from Violet asap). So, in lieu of ordering a $2749674 cake this evening, Isabelle and I decided to make <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/mint-cookies-n-cream-cupcakes/">these</a> instead.
