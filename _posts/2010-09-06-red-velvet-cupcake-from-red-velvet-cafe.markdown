title: "Red Velvet Cupcake from Red Velvet Cafe"
---
Red Velvet Cafe rocks my world! And when I say "rocks my world" what I really mean is that it's a darned good thing that Vegas is a state away or I would be there so much that they might consider getting a restraining order.

Until recently, I have never had the experience of enjoying any desserts at Red Velvet Cafe because Vegas, being the home of Ronald's donuts, always inflicts this duty in me to eat my weight in donuts, leaving no room in my dessert stomach (yes, <em>it is</em> a different stomach...duh) for anything else. However, it just so happened that on this particular day, our flight landed right about the time that Ronald's was closing for the day and wouldn't reopen until 4am the next morning. So...I purposely only ate half of my tuna melt so that I could save room for dessert, and that could very well have been the best decision of my life...or at least the day.

This cupcake was not only the perfect amount of moistness with the perfect flavored icing, but it was HUGE, as every cupcake should be. Some of the woosie-assed cupcakes I see around here make me feel a pig (more than usual) because I have to eat 2 (or 4) of them to be satisfied. Here's a hint to all vegan bakers of the world. Ignore the part of the recipe that says to fill the cups 2/3 of the way. Fill them up! We love it when they puff up over the top and look like muffins when they come out of the oven! LOVE! That's the way cupcakes should be.

So, finally, what we've all been waiting for: the drool material.
