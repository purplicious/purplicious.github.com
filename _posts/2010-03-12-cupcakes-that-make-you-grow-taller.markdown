title: "Cupcakes that make you grow taller"
---
We had a friend date where about 10 girls got together and bake a gazillion cupcakes. Some were very experienced cupcake bakers and even had large storage bins full of cute cupcake papers and sprinkles, but they were all new to vegan cupcakes, so I took charge of the situation. The kind neighbors even brought us some homemade sangria to make the cupcake baking go even better. Since we had an Alice in Wonderland theme party to go to that night, Jessica and Jocelyn made cute little eat me tags for the cupcakes so we could bring them with us to the event. I wish I had more pictures of the actual baking (and audio files of the insane dialogue that takes place when you get 10 girls together), but since I don't participate in facebook, I don't get to steal photos from other people's pages. I am on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jessicaspacekat/4469215004/" target="_blank">flickr</a>, however.
