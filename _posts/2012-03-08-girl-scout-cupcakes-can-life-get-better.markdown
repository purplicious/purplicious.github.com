title: "Girl Scout Cupcakes? Can life get better?"

I was pretty sure I had hit a high point in life a couple of years ago when Douglas' ex-co-worker made vegan samoas, and I got to have one for my very own. But I was wrong. I'm pretty sure this vegan cupcake version of a samoa wins by a long shot. I can't wait to make them! But until then, I'll be drooling over this picture of them.
