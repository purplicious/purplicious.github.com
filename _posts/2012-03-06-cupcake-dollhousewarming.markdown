title: "Cupcake dollhousewarming"
---
Virginia had the most amazing idea of making cupcake (and other sweets, if you believe in those) hair accessories, and since I had just moved into my new dollhouse, we decided to make it a cupcake-themed dollhousewarming party. I know, I know, I should have thought of something more original....if I have to go to another cupcake-themed dollhousewarming party, I will seriously rip my hair out. Well, mediocrity is just the theme of my life...if you don't like it, don't read about it.

In addition to making hair accessories, we also had the option of decorating cupcakes to match our hair creation. I'm not sure what happened to the rest of the photographs from this event. There may have been one of my first hair accessory, which was a 3D cupcake on a headband, but it was so ugly that I asked Zen to hide it forever, which ended up turning into a fun game of him laughing everytime he saw it, and me wishing I had burned it on a stake. Luckily, no photographic evidence remains of that failed attempt, and I still had plenty of time to make the smallish cupcake bow featured in this lovely photo taken by Josipa.
