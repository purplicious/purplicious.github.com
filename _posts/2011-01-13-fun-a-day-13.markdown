Tonight is <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/2011/01/10/sf-vegan-bakesale-this-saturday/">bakesale</a> preparation night! I realize the bake sale isn't until Saturday, but you really shouldn't put things off until the last minute. Okay, I admit, I always put things off until the last minute. The real reason I am all of a sudden not a procrastinator tonight is because the cupcakes are being delivered through a chain of multiple people tomorrow to find their way to the bakesale safely (I hope!)

So, the <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/voodoo-ronalds-donut-cupcakes-recipe/">recipe</a> for the bakesale cupcakes is the same one I used last weekend for <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/2011/01/08/fun-a-day-8/">Gabe's birthday cupcakes</a>. The only difference being that the bakesale cupcake won't be covered in fondant versions of super mario brothers details. The bakesale is trying to appeal to a wider audience, not just nerdy-videogame-loving-30ish-adults-that-act-like-children (although if the majority of the bakesale attendees fall into that category, then yay!)

I hope the doggies and the birdies get lots of money from these cupcakes because they are a pain in the tail feathers to make let me tell you. Since I already posted the recipe last weekend, all you get today is more photos of the process of assembling these bad boys.

Oh, and the superb Vi Zahajszky, author of KQED's food blog, Bay Area Bites, wrote <a href="http://blogs.kqed.org/bayareabites/2011/01/14/sf-vegan-bakesale-eat-cake-save-animals/" target="_blank">this lovely article</a> about the bakesale.
