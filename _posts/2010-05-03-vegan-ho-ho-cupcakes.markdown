title: "Vegan Ho Ho cupcakes"
---
in addition to having the best mock-meat-lovers pizza I have ever tasted (called the animal lovers pizza-how friggen cute is that?!) and a vegan version of the Samoa girl scout cookie, City O City in Denver, CO also has these amazingly gigantic Ho-Ho cupcakes! These babies are so decadent that even a piggie like me had to share it. If I lived in Denver, I would be a fattie fat fatso and the happiest one you'd ever meet. Until winter.
