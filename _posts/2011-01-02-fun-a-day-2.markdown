title: "Fun-a-day 2"

Happy 2nd day in the new year! Otherwise known in these parts as the second cupcake-a-day! So, because I was forced to leave my vehicle parked in SF Friday night/yesterday morning due to my blood alcohol content being 375.6, I had to try to think of a way to get my car back. Luckily, I have a Kylene in my life. If you don't have one, I highly suggest acquiring one immediately. A Kylene is a cute friend who is not only fun and brings you cute vegan presents (even though she's not vegan herself), but pretty much never says no to any favor you ask of her. She's amazing and life would be paltry without her. So, cupcake-a-day today was dedicated to making Kylene a thank-you-for-being-the-awesomest-friend-in-the-world-and-driving-my-car-40-miles-to-bring-it-back-to-me present. This present consists of the flavor of cupcake that is apparently Kylene's self-claimed favorite of all the cupcakes I have ever baked for her experienced cupcake palette to sample. She's not the only one who likes them. They won third place in the <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/2009/09/29/cupcake-themed-party/">RPS cupcake contest</a> last year too. I call them ET's favorite cupcakes, because to me, they taste like reeses pieces.*Â  They are chocolate cupcakes with peanut butter filling and peanut butter icing, and even thought Kylene generally is not a fan of peanut butter (even with chocolate! weird right?), she seems to love these. My recipe is similar to the one in Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World, but if you don't have that book or you want to try my version, you can check out the recipe <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/e-t-cupcake-recipe/">here</a>.

*In all fairness, I could be miles from accurate with my assessment of what they taste like, because I haven't had reeses pieces in over a decade. BTW, anyone who finds me the vegan version of reeses pieces is not only going to be responsible for future cavities and a 10 pound weight gain, but is also my new god(dess), and I will name my next cupcake recipe after you.
