title: "Fun-a-day 17"
---
I'm usually pretty amazed at the amount of good ideas I can manage to come up with when intoxicated. Either they're good ideas or I just think they're really good due to my altered state. Regardless, cupcake-a-day #17 is the result of an epiphany I had at Pamela's cocktail party on New Year's Eve. Being the classy bunch that we are, we were sipping our fancy cocktails out of red plastic solo cups. The upside to red solo cups is that they hold a lot, which is always important for every new year's eve. The downside is that after drinking the contents of one of these, you start to set your cup down and then forget which of the numerous red cups is yours. So, at the time, my first brilliant plan was for each person to write their name on their cups. So, Emily found us a black pen and we all wrote our names on our cups. However, when you have an icy beverage, the condensation on the outside of the cup turns any markings that once resembled a name into black smudges all over everyone's hands. So, at this point, we are not only returned to our original issue, but we now all have dirty hands..haha. Luckily we were on drink 2 or 5 at this point and so it didn't really matter. But that's when I came up with my brilliant solution. Solo cup cozies! I decided that for Pam's next birthday, she's getting a set of solo cup cozies so that at our next cocktail soiree, each guest will have their own personalized cup. Tonight I made the first one in the set which is (surprise!) cupcake themed. This was also my first journey into the realm of installing snaps. I only wasted about half the package, but I'm basically a professional now. You can tell by the asymmetry. Only professionals can do that. It's true. Look it up. But look at these pretty pictures first and hopefully their beauty will help you forget what you were gonna look up.
