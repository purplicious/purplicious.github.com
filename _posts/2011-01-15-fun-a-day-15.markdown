The button on the scarf is supposed to be the cherry on the cupcake. By the way, why is it that every time we draw a cupcake, we make a cherry on top? When you examine the ratio of non-edible cupcakes with cherries to edible ones with cherries, I figure it would be something like 379562:1. Really, when is the last time you ate a cupcake with a cherry on it? I'm pretty sure I can honestly answer never.
