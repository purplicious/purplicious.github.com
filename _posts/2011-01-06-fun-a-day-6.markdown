cupcake-a-day 6 tried to make me fail by the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mocfasf/5341322992/" target="_blank">etsy craft lab</a> running out of supplies during my project. luckily, Jessica and I overcame their jinx by having the brilliant idea of turning the pieces from my would-be bib necklace into buttonhole jacket decorations. Thank you Amber for having a camera with a flash and for being so prompt in your cupcake craft photo delivery!
