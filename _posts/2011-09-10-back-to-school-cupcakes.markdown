Apparently, cupcakes are the new apple because Isabelle insisted on bringing cupcakes to school on the first day of 4th grade. Kylene (former 2nd grade teacher) said that this tactic was a good one, because not only are cupcakes wayyyyy better than apples (those might not have been the exact words she used), but it would ensure that Isabelle will be well-liked by all the cupcake-eating nine-year-olds. I suggested the idea of making cupcake minis for numerous reasons including 1) the children are mini and therefore their cupcakes should match, 2) making 29 full-sized cupcakes means tripling the batch, which is just ridiculous, and 3) I figured for the teacher's first day back after summer break, she might not appreciate having a class full of children drugged on high quantities of sugar.
So, Isabelle chose chocolate cupcakes with mint icing. Over the course of 2 nights, she made all the cupcakes herself and was ultra excited to use the piping bag to ice them for her very first time.
