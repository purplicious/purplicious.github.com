---
<div>Quantity: unknown. I used this recipe to make a big top cupcake, but lets just guess that it would have made around 22 small top cupcakes.

Cake Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>2 c flour</li>
	<li>1 t baking soda</li>
	<li>1 t baking powder</li>
	<li>½ t salt</li>
	<li>2 c shredded coconut</li>
	<li>2/3 c coconut oil</li>
	<li>½ c pineapple juice (from canned pineapple)</li>
	<li>1 ½ c sugar</li>
	<li>1 and 3/4 c coconut milk (1 can)</li>
	<li>1/4 c soymilk</li>
	<li>1 T vanilla extract</li>
	<li>1 T apple cider vinegar</li>
</ul>
Cake Directions

Melt oil in glass measuring cup in oven (or on stove using low heat if you don't have a pyrex measuring cup). Add sugar, milks, vanilla, and pineapple juice to coconut oil and whisk to combine.

Sift together the first 4 dry ingredients in a large bowl. Add the coconut.

Add dry ingredients to wet, until incorporated. Add vinegar. Mix slightly and pour.

Bake in a 350º oven for 24 minutes.

Filling Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>1 can pineapple</li>
	<li>½ c sugar</li>
	<li>1/4 cup cornstarch</li>
	<li>1 c pineapple juice (dilute with water if there's not enough)</li>
</ul>
Filling Directions

Stir together sugar, pineapple, and half of the juice in a saucepan over low heat. 

In separate bowl, using a whisk or an immersion blender, blend the remaining juice with the cornstarch, and then add to the saucepan. 

Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes or until very thick. Cool.

Icing Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>½ c earth balance coconut spread</li>
	<li>½ c palm shortening</li>
	<li>1 t vanilla</li>
	<li>½ cup coconut milk (use the part from the can that is thicker)</li>
	<li>4 c powdered sugar</li>
</ul>
Icing Directions

Beat together the earth balance, palm shortening, and coconut milk until fluffy.

Add the confectioner’s sugar, sifting it in, and then beat until smooth and fluffy (~3 minutes).

Add vanilla and beat for 3 more minutes.
