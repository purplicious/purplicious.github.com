title: "New Vegan Cupcake shop in England"
---
If Pam and I ever make our long-talked-about trip to England, this is the first place I intend to go. No, it isn't the website, which is a cross between Saturn Cafe's and a porn site, that is luring me in, it's the delicious vegan cupcakes.

This cupcake-porn heaven is called <a href="http://www.mscupcake.co.uk/" target="_blank">Ms. Cupcake</a>, and can I just say that she makes Toffee Fudge cupcakes!!!!!!!!!! Someone mail me one!!!!

Oh, and will you look at her marvelous hat????
