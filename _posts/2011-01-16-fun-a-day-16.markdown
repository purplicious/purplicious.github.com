Chris and Evelyn love us so much that they sent us 2 boxes of chick-o-sticks! This is basically a lifetime supply of chick-o-sticks for an average family of bears, but luckily, I am a very creative bear. This is where the invention of butterfinger cupcakes came from. The world will have Chris and Evelyn to thank for <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/butterfinger-cupcakes-recipe/">this recipe</a>.

I took some pictures of the process since it's a newly invented recipe. I am normally a proponent of filling cupcake papers almost all the way so as to maximize the amount of cucpake, but in this recipe, it's best to not overfill or the chick-o-sticks in the batter will make the cucpakes stick to the pan.

Isabelle was in charge of mashing the chick-o-sticks. For the ones that went into the batter, she put them into a ziplock freezer bag and used to a rolling pin to beat them like a battered spouse. My plan was to use the rolling pin to roll them into small pieces, but apparently, chick-o-sticks are harder than I thought so the rolling pin basically posed as a hammer. When it was time to make the icing, I brought up the idea of using the mortar and pestle to pulverize the sticks into a fine dust. That was a much quieter method. I suggest that one for the future. I also considered a food processor, but never made it that far. Maybe next time...
