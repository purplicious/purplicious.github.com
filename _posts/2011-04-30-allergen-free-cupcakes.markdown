24 chocolate vegan gluten-free cupcakes (recipe from Babycakes cookbook)

Ingredients
<ul>
	<li>1.75 c garbanzo-fava bean flour</li>
	<li>1/2 c potato starch</li>
	<li>1 c cocoa powder</li>
	<li>1/4 c arrowroot powder</li>
	<li>1.5 T Hain Featherweight brand Baking Powder*</li>
	<li>1/2 t baking soda</li>
	<li>1/2 t xantham gum</li>
	<li>2 t salt</li>
	<li>1 c coconut oil, melted in the oven</li>
	<li>1.5 c agave nectar</li>
	<li>3/4 c applesauce</li>
	<li>3 T vanilla extract</li>
	<li>1 c hot water</li>
</ul>
*If you don't have that brand of baking powder and you are making these for someone with a corn allergy, substitute with the following: 1 t baking soda, 2 t cream of tartar, and 2 t arrowroot

Directions

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, potato starch, cocoa powder, arrowroot, baking powder, baking soda, xanthan gum, and salt. Add the oil, agave nectar, applesauce, vanilla, and hot water directly to the dry ingredients. Stir until the batter is smooth.

Pour batter into each prepared cup until they are almost entirely full. Bake the cupcakes on the center rack for 22 minutes, rotating the tray 180 degrees after 15 minutes. The cupcakes will bounce back when pressed and a toothpick inserted in the center will come out clean. Remove from the oven.

Let the cupcakes stand for 20 minutes. Transfer them to a wire rack right side up and cool completely. Place the cupcakes in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
