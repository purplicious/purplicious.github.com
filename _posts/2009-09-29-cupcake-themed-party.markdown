title: "Cupcake themed party"
---
Today is Kylene's birthday (happy birthday Kylene!) and she is a fellow fan of cupcakes so we threw a cupcake themed party for her. She got a cupcake card and I made her very favorite cupcakes - Red Velvet.  I made up a recipe since all the ones I found online were the new school style that requires an entire bottle of food coloring (mmm..yum! Red dye #40).  <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/?page_id=14">My recipe</a> is old school style, using beets instead.

Akiko made this huge chocolate chip cookie (not vegan) and I decorated it with what other than a cupcake.

These cupcakes are mostly vegan (sorry, the cute sprinkles aren't) but nobody at my work is vegan so they didn't mind.  I got these sprinkles as one of my gifts for winning third place in the cupcake bake-off at RPS this year.

100% vegan ones:

In addition to eating, we also played cupcake games that I found on a child's birthday party website (we're all kids at my work, so it seemed appropriate).
