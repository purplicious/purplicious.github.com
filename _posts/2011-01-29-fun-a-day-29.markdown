Pamela has a life full of everything cute, which not only gives you a warm fuzzy feeling whenever you enter her domain, but it's also a good opportunity to cute-ify yourself when in her presence. I used these nail polish pens to (badly) draw cupcakes on my toenails. Whenever I complain of my ineptness at drawing, Zen usually tries to console me by mentioning that I can draw cupcakes. Sometimes, he's right. In this situation, he clearly is not. I would like to provide a warning at this time, for those who have weak stomachs or just have an aversion to feet in general, you are about to see photos of feet. I apologize in advance if you already saw the photos before receiving the warning. The strangest part of this is how my cupcake looks more realistic after a few hours of wearing shoes and socks. Art is so mysterious. haha.
