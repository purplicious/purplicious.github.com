Tic - Tac - Toe! This was Zen's idea, and who doesn't love to play a game of tic-tac-toe, especially when you don't have to waste paper (I mean if you're not using a reusable tic-tac-toe board, you might as well be driving a hummer). It was supposed to be chocolate cupcakes versus vanilla cupcakes, but the first game I played with Douglas, I was white cupcakes and he was black, but I won. And we all know in real life, vanilla would never win over chocolate, so this game is clearly make-believe. But isn't make-believe cute?!
