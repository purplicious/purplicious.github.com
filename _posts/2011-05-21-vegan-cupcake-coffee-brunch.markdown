title: "Vegan Cupcake & Coffee Brunch"
---
Have you ever thought to yourself, "I have the best friends in the entire world?" Well, you would be wrong, because my friends are the best in the whole world, making yours second best. That's how ranking works. I know this because I recently started using the rank function in excel for our coffee club at work. I have also learned that if two kinds of coffee have the same ranking (and therefore are tied), then the following ranking skips a number. So, I believe that currently the peaberry from bluebottle and the hair bender from stumptown are in a tie for position 2. That means that the next highest score is ranked 4. Mhm. I'm basically the ranking expert, so unless you are part of my friend circle, you cannot possible have better friends than the ones I have. And why are my friends so awesome, you ask? Besides the obvious reasons (including their cute factor, their ability-to-put-up-with-me factor, and their fun factor), they also happen to know how to plan the most amazing events! Last weekend is a prime example of this unprecedented skill of theirs. Last weekend, they planned the most amazing of all amazing brunches ever....

Vegan Cupcake and Coffee Brunch! You might think that this is not much of a feat, considering there's no "real" food involved, but considering I am the only vegan in the group, and that this was the first attempt at vegan baking for many of them (first attempt at any baking for one of them), this was basically the best thing ever!

When Amber heard about the cupcake brunch, she suggested there may be too much sweet for one brunch, so Pam and I responded to her concern with pizza cupcakes and spinach and mushroom quiche cupcakes with sun-dried tomato cream cheese icing, in an (inane) effort to have a healthy option.

Thanks to Eidelyn for being the talented event photographer, as usual. We started the brunch by each eating one of the cupcakes we made ourselves. Don't ask how many more we ate after that.

*Yes, she always matches her cupcakes. And here was our attempt at setting the timer on the camera.
