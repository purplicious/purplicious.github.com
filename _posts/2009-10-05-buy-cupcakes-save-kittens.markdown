title: "Buy cupcakes, save kittens!"
---
I just got an email from Laura at <a href="http://vegansaurus.com/" target="_blank">vegansaurus</a> and she confirmed that I will be baking some astonishingly cute cupcakes for the vegan bakesale that's now less than 2 weeks away!Â  100% of the proceeds are going to Give Me Shelter Cat Rescue, so go to Ike's and buy one of my cute cupcakes and help save kittys!
