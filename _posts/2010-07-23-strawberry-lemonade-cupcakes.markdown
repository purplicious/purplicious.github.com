title: "Strawberry lemonade cupcakes"
---
I made these to bring to my friend Sam in LA this weekend. I texted him, "chocolate or lemon" with no other reference or information and he texted back lemon. So, I decided to try the strawberry lemonade cupcakes that won the RPS bake-off two years ago. Luckily, my friend Emily came over last night so I put her to work molding tiny lemons out of marzipan. She claims to not be domestic but apparently people will do anything for a cupcake. haha.
