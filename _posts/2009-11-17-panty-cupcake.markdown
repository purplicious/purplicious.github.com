title: "Panty cupcake?"
---
I was just going through my inbox and deleting emails that I don't have time to read or reply to...yes, I've become one of those.  If you email me and you want me to read it, you need to make the subject line something very interesting in order to get me to read it.  So, in that vain, I came across an email with the subject line reading, "Free Panty Cupcake." Just the fact that it had the word cupcake caught my eye, then my second thought was some vegan chocolate cupcakes with little fondant panties on top (would this not be the perfect bridal shower or lingerie party snack?).  I opened the email. My excitement dwindled rapidly when I saw the picture of the "panty cupcake."

Thanks a lot victoria's secret.  Only someone disturbed enough to make a bra that increases your breasts by 2 cup sizes would falsely market a panty cupcake by offering you cupcake made out of panties....GROSS...and sick and wrong!
