title: "Cafe Flore Strawberry shortcake cupcake"
---
After accepting an invitation to vegan brunch from Shane, Jessica and I had a planning session for our next LA road trip over a raw cacao (cacao!) shake and a tuna melt that was not as tasty as the one from Red Velvet, but probably healthier. Since Jessica was too full for dessert, we took it to go. they had 2 kinds of GF vegan cupcakes, as well as 4 varieties of regular ones and this most delicious looking strawberry shortcake cupcake.
