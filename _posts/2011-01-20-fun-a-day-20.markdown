cupcake-a-day #20 has an element of secrecy. it's kind of one of those for me to know and you to find out things. as soon as there is no danger of being discovered, I will post photos, accompanied by an explanation.

So...here we are a few days after the secret post. I'm sure nobody has been losing sleep over this, but it's time to reveal the big secret. So, for a few months, we were planning a surprise half-birthday party* for Jessica and my cupcake project for Thursday night was to make cupcake coasters as party favors for the party. In fear of her reading the blog and me spoiling part or all of the surprise, I had to leave my post unfinished. The coasters we Pamela's idea since we were having a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chocolatecupcakes/5383749934/" target="_blank">tea party for Jessica</a>, it made perfect sense to have <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jocelyntran/5381582036" target="_blank">the coasters</a> as the souvenir.

*Doesn't everyone celebrate their half-birthday? Well, if they don't then they are missing out! Who wouldn't want another holiday to have as an excuse to get all your friends together all dressed up?
