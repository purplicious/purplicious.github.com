title: "Jelly Belly cupcake decorating contest"
---
I *was* excited about this contest when Jocelyn first told me about it because I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chocolatecupcakes/4863362891/" target="_blank">already</a> often decorate cupcakes with jelly bellys since they're actually a vegan decoration that is easy to acquire, but after seeing some of the cupcakes other people have made, intimidation has set in 150%.
