A couple of months ago, Jessica discovered a cookbook written by a bed and breakfast in Kentucky at her mom's house and decided it would be great to make this scrumptious looking coffee cake recipe from the book. I agreed that coffee cake sounded good. I like coffee. I like cake. How can it be bad?

Then, at work, I found out that the birthday party theme for January/February birthdays is breakfast. So, being the one that usually bakes the birthday cupcakes, I was trying to think of what kind of cake would be acceptable as a breakfast item, when I remembered Jessica's b&amp;b coffee cake!

So, tonight we decided to turn ShojoPop night into backwoods country cooking night and not only veganized the coffee cake recipe, but also turned it into coffee cake cupcakes. We learned a few things from this process, including the following.

1.  Do not spread the blueberry layer all the way to the edges or it compromises the structural integrity of the cupcake.

2.  Do not ever open a bed and breakfast because the amount of work involved in making coffee cake is totally not worth the effort.

3.  Coffee cake is supposed to have cinnamon. I guess people in Kentucky don't use cinnamon in their coffee cake, but here in California, we think coffee cake without cinnamon is just, just, just weird.

4.  Jessica looks unbelievably adorable in a le petite apron and chef hat.

Here are some pictures of the process. I will try to post the recipe within the next couple of days.
