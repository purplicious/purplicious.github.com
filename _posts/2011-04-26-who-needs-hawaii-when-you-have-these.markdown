title: "Who needs hawaii, when you have these?"

Most of the time, when I see delicious looking vegan cupcakes, it makes me want to eat them. Occasionally, I come across one or many that make me want to bathe in them. But this could very well be the first time that I have actually wanted to be a cupcake. And the amazing cupcake artist who hath done this to me is none other than <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sweetelitescupcakes/5639276094">sweet elites vegan cupcakes</a>! Check out these Pi√±a Colada Cupcakes with the umbrellas.

I had an umbrella on my drink in Hawaii, but why do we never get umbrellas at the bars in SF? It's bullshit really. Next time I order my absolute press with lime, I'm going to say, "absolute press with lime and a purple umbrella please." I'll let you know how it goes. Until then, if you are not the type of person to spend a day in the kitchen making hawaiian resorts in a cupcake paper liner, you can order these direct from Fresno, CA, and have them delivered*!!!!

* You have to order 6 dozen to have them delivered to the bay area, so let's pull our resources! Do I have 5 friends who want to go in on these with me?
