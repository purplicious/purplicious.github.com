title: "Valentine Cupcakes"

These are so cute that it's almost worth the effort of making them. If I had a dish washer or a dish slave, then I think it would even out, but as of now, I don't know that I'll be making these again. You basically have to bake twice because you bake the hearts first. Virginia always sends me the cutest cupcake ideas and <a href="http://bakeitinacake.com/recipes/heartinacupcake">this</a> was one that she sent me. So, I of course had to make a vegan version, which was basically just the vanilla cupcake recipe from VCTOTW. Although, if I make them again, I will make more batter because these cupcakes came out kind of tiny. Which in this instance was fine because they were for tiny people. You also may be wondering why I opted for brown hearts instead of pink. GOOD question! I wanted pink hearts, but 2 of Isabelle's classmates have allergies to red food coloring, so I thought I would be sly and get the all natural food coloring from whole foods (which costs around $20), but to my disappointment, the "red" is actually brown. *sigh*
