Happy January 4! I had to make something easy tonight since I went to my work's annual holiday/new year party.

Me: Bye. Thanks for having me.

Them: Why are you leaving so soon?

Me: I have a cupcake pincushion to make.

The conversation didn't really go that way, but I did have a discussion with Alissa and her partner, Sonny, and they both brought the possibility that by January 31 (or sooner), I may grow to hate cupcake. ::gasp:: Is that a possibility? Does anyone in the entire world hate cupcakes? I just did a google search and there is apparently a facebook group for people who hate cupcakes and it actually has 148 members! In fact, in October 2010, Pierre Antoine said, "cupcakes are retard." Yeah, Antoine. Cupcakes aren't the only ones riding the short bus buddy. Anywho...there's a possibility that I already own a pincushion (ok, fine I have 2), but does anyone really like the tomato pincushion. It's kind of too hard to easily put your pins in one-handed, and I've never been one to enjoy having the same something as everyone else. Let's face it, the tomato pincushion is thumbs down. So, what kind of pincushion is thumbs up? I thought you'd never ask.
