title: "Vampire birthday party"
---
Isabelle is turning 8 and she requested a vampire themed birthday party.  A vampire birthday party for 7-8 year olds consists of this:

1.  A game of munchkin bites (a vampire card game)

2.  A dinner of brains and blood (pasta with marinara), fingers and blood (fries with ketchup), and blood (cherry juice) to drink.

3.  Isabelle requested chocolate cupcakes with gray mint flavored icing and she decorated them with vegan gummies in the shapes of drops of blood and skulls.

<p style="text-align: left;">Your next question (if you're like me at least) should be where did these wonderfully vampirific gummies come from?  They have them in the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chocolatecupcakes/3696231675/" target="_blank">Sidecar for Pigs Peace</a> vegan store in Seattle, but you can also find them online.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">4.  The remainder of the itinerary included maniacal children running up and down the hallways while they're supposed to be sleeping.  There are 3 boys in a room on one end of the hallway and 3 girls in a room on the other end of the hallway. It's just too difficult for their coven to be separated apparently.  I think it's time for me to go threaten them with garlic.</p>
