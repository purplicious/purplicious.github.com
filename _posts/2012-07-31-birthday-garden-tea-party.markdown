While scrolling through Danielle's endless tumblr feed one night, we came across an adorable picture of My Melody having a tea party. It was so cute that I sent it to Jocelyn to remind her that we had talked about having a tea party for my birthday. To my amazement, she used it to create this this super cute invitation for my birthday party!

Instead of cupcakes, there's a possibility that my post-Jocelyn's-bachelorette-party euphoria persuaded me to falsely agree to make some sort of mini ice cream sandwiches using a teeny biscuit cutter. However, due to a work happy hour gone bad the night before, once the day actually arrived, I downgraded my plans to making colored sugar cubes, modeled after the ones they use at crown & crumpet.

While I didn't actually make any vegan cupcakes for this event, I made up for it by eating <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/frescafresh/7239546078/in/set-72157629825980694" target="_blank">some that Emily made</a>. In addition to Emily's delicious cookies-n-cream cupcakes, Jessica (played by the part of sailor moon) also made vegan petits fours, which while they are aren't technically cake that is in a cup, they are in a heart shape, which makes them more loving versions of cupcakes, and therefore worthy of a blog tutorial.

To begin the process of making petits fours (or any other creation born in the kitchen, really), you must wear an apron that changes your identity, preferable in a way that you gives you some sort of special powers.

Step 1: Use my standard chocolate cupcake recipe for the batter, but pour a thin layer onto a parchment-lined cookie sheet. Once baked, use a cookie cutter to make the teeny tiny cake layers.

Step 2: Spread a thin layer of preserves over half the shapes.

Step 3: Top of each petit with another layer making a mini cake sandwich.

Step 4: Cover everything in chocolate. I wish I had more photos of things (people) covered in chocolate.

Step 5: I'm pretty sure you have to be Sailor Moon to be able to make these little hearts that go on top, because what normal human can do that?!

Step 6: Nom nom nom.

It's a good thing I ate so many cupcakes and petits fours, because other than those, there really wasn't anything else to eat...

...or drink. (Just because it has the word tea in the name of the party doesn't mean that you can't have Josipa's famous barbie sangria.)

Another requirement of tea parties that nobody informed me of before this one is that you're supposed to paint your nails to match your dress.

In addition to the wide variety of homosapien friends in attendance, I was also blessed by the presence of another species of visitor.

The Virginia-Lulu duo were the masterminds behind the purple teapot pinata. Before scrolling down, can you guess who was lucky batter to break the teapot?

We managed to remember to get a picture of everyone before they trickled off into the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chocolatecupcakes/7238247622" target="_blank">solar eclipse</a>, but one person may have changed out of their tea-party-outfit and into their eclipse-outfit a little bit too quickly for us.
