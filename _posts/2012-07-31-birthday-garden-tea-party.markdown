Best Birthday Ever = dressing up + cute vegan foods + teapot shaped purple pinatas + turquoise patio furniture + heart shaped sugar cubes

While scrolling through Danielle's endless tumblr feed one night, we came across an adorable picture of My Melody having a tea party. It was so cute that I sent it to Jocelyn to remind her that we had talked about having a tea party for my birthday. To my amazement, she used it to create this this super cute invitation for my birthday party!

I'm pretty sure I had previously agreed to make some sort of mini ice cream sandwiches using a teeny biscuit cutter, but when the day actually arrived, and I wasn't even sure I could remember how to walk, I downgraded my plans to making colored sugar cubes, modeled after the ones they use at crown & crumpet.

In addition to the wide variety of human friends in attendance, I was also blessed by the presence of another type of visitor.

The Virginia-Lulu duo were the masterminds behind the purple teapot pinata. Before scrolling down, can you guess who was lucky batter to shatter the teapot?

We managed to remember to get a picture of everyone before they trickled off into the solar eclipse, but one person may have changed out of their tea-party-outfit and into their eclipse-outfit a little bit too quickly for us.
