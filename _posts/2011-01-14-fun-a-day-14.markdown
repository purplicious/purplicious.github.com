While traveling recently, I came to an epiphany that earplugs, while safe, useful, and important, are the ugliest things in the world (except for anteaters: I wanted to get one of those to help out with my ant problem in my kitchen, but they're just so ugly that I think I would be embarrassed to have company over). So, except for anteaters, earplugs are very likely the ugliest things ever. And unlike facial masks or hair curlers, we typically wear earplugs in public places where people could potentially be judging us. So, I decided to create an earplug mask if you will. Something that hides the ugliness of earplugs, without sacrificing the usability. Tadaaaaaaaaa.
