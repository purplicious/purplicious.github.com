title: "Cupcake apron"
---
Yes, this apron has vegan cupcakes on it and no, you may not eat them. You can lick them if you can find this apron, but it will be hard to find as it is about to travel from california to florida to philly to new jersey. You might have to settle for licking your computer monitor. Oh don't act like you've never done that before...pervert!

I created this apron for my good friend Melissa because she just started a vegan food truck in New Jersey and therefore needs an apron (clearly). I loved the blue and pink cupcake fabric, and when I realized that I would be lining it anyway, blue bear suggested that I make it reversible! Genius! I love reversible clothes and although I have none, I always think about them and covet them. This apron came out so cute that I kinda want to keep it. But Melissa should have it I guess. Well, maybe we'll see if she has good behavior before we decide. haha. Before you say, why is it all poochy at the top, please understand that the mannequinn has size A boobs, whereas Melissa (I don't know this for a fact because I don't have a special skill to just look at boobs and know what size they are) has size D boobs. When discussing this with blue bear during the creation of the apron, he requested that I not use the word boobs when we have company. So many rules....
