title: "Belated Birthday cupcakes"
---
So, Pamela missed her friends birthday and felt super bad so we knew we couldn't make just any old cupcake recipe to make up for that. We decided on the cookies n cream cupcakes from Vegan Cupcakes Take Over The World because who doesn't love Newman O's, Chocolate cupcakes with cookies inside them, and big dollops of icing mixed with cookie crumbs. If you don't already have the book, what are you doing even reading this. Command T and go to half.com and buy the book IMMEDIATELY!Â  Here's some pictures from that day.
