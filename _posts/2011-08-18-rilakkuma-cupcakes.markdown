Jessica (like myself) is pretty good at drawing out the whole birthday thing to get as much mileage out of it as possible. She'll never be as good as I am at this, but she can always strive for my status.*  Being the good student that she is, Jessica had a super fun adventure on her birthday week that involved a scavenger hunt each day with fun games such as this one:
<a rel="attachment wp-att-960" href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/2011/08/18/rilakkuma-cupcakes/puzzle/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-960" title="scavenger-hunt" src="http://ieatcupcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/puzzle-408x510.png" alt="" width="408" height="510" /></a>

And on the final day, she received a super cute rilakkuma soap dispenser for all her hard work during her birthday week.

Then, true to the milking-a-birthday-for-all-it's-worth mentality, she got to have a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chocolatecupcakes/sets/72157627425671870/with/6048653362/" target="_blank">birthday party</a> 2 weeks after her birthday! It was a super fun and crazy party, one in which I did not want to leave, but luckily, Lulu and Randy (thank you guys!) were ready to go at a reasonable hour so I was able to wake up in the morning and drag myself out of bed to take my mommy to brunch in SF. The best part of the entire party was when Jessica made the rule that all cupcakes had to be eaten in a lady-and-the-tramp-pasta-scene style. Oh, the fun! The best ones are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chocolatecupcakes/6039779820/in/set-72157627425671870">here</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chocolatecupcakes/6048100777/in/set-72157627425671870">here</a>.

This post is all out of order. So, let's get into a DeLorean and go back to the day of Jessica's party when we were at Great America all day, and around 5 something I remembered that I was supposed to make cupcakes for her party! So, we raced home, and I baked the fastest batch of <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/e-t-cupcake-recipe/">peanut butter chocolate cupcakes</a> that I have ever baked in my life. I got home at 6:15pm and Lulu and Randy were coming at 7:30pm to pick me up. I still needed to shower and get ready for the party, make dinner for the family, eat (this is important because whenever I drink without eating dinner, bad bad things happen), and make and decorate the cupcakes. There was no way I would have gotten all of this done without my child-mom-slave labor camp I employ. Look at them hard at work!
