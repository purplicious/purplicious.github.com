title: "Fun-a day 9"
---
Sunday should be a lazy day, but instead, I woke up before 9am and started organizing fabric and deciding what to make for cupcake-a-day #9. The fabric I was color coding was from an organization called "FabMo" that rescues fabric samples from the landfill. They request that you use it in a way that gives back to the community and they request a donation to be able to keep running, but other than those rules, it's basically free fabric. So, I went for my first time yesterday (after a year and a half of meaning to check it out) and got a few bags of small pieces of fabric. So, my plan is this: since Jessica and I now have a new etsy store called ShojoPop, I decided to convert my Purplicious store into a non-profit-esque one, in which all profits from all sales are donated to some animal rescuing organization. I haven't worked out many of the details yet, but I started off my morning organizing the fabric I got and making 3 market bags. I only made one cupcake themed, but if it sells, then I'll likely make more...who wouldn't want a market bag with a cupcake applique on it? Nobody could resist that right? Well, maybe they could, but they might just buy it anyway...to help animals. I'll try this for a year and see how it goes. I brought it up to the craft group last night at Gabe's birthday party and everyone is willing to devote one night each month to making things for the animals. Yay for awesome friends!!!!

The cupcake tote was made with soft purple chenille ottoman(70% cotton; 30% rayon). The color is called Mulberry and the fabric was made by <a href="http://kravet.com/fabrics/couture.htm" target="_blank">Kravet Couture</a> in New York, USA.
