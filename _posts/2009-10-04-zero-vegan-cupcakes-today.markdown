title: "zero vegan cupcakes today :("
---
Clearly, I should not be mentioning World Veg Day in this blog since they clearly were unable to supply me with the cupcakes I desired.  Sugar Beat Sweets were there, but had nothing to feed me, and that's just wrong!  However, the topic of cupcakes arose on numerous occasions, so that's excuse enough for me to mention the event.

I'll start off by describing my brunch.  Marcie hosted her annual vegan brunch at her place in upper nob hill where she and many other chefs in our group of friends prepared the following fare:
Homestyle potatoes
<a href="http://www.vegan-food.net/recipe/1370/Okonomiyaki-Savoury-Vegetable-Pancakes/">Okonomiyaki (veggie pancakes)</a>
Pumpkin Muffins
Fruit Salad
Waffles
French Toast
Tofu Scramble
Biscuits and Sausage gravy
Spinach Quiche
Bacon
Sausage
Mimosas
Coffee
Was that everything because it really seemed like there was more?  Regardless, we ate like piggies, only we used plates and forks, which was very human-like.  After we filled the bellies, we headed over to GG Park for World Veg Day.  I didn't get a chance to check out every booth, but a few of the vendors that were represented were Alternative Baking Company, Maggie Mudd, Parma, Lydia's Lovin Foods, Wildwood, Coconut Bliss, and tons more.  What we did instead of checking out vendors was watch 2 lectures.  The first was the author of Skinny Bitch.  It was more of an interview than a lecture, where someone from vegnews asked her questions for the first half hour and the second half hour was questions from the audience.  This chick was born in NJ and clearly has a potty mouth that she was trying very hard to curb dude to the young ages of some of the children in the audience.  However, since the title of her book had the word bitch in it, you can guess how that went.  haha.  Something she said that kind of struck home was that each of us do something in order to try to save animals lives, be that leading by example or leafletting or even (she actually said this) baking people vegan cupcakes so they can see how yummy they are.  This is such the goal of my ieatcupcakes life.  Sharing vegan cupcakes with non-vegans so they can see how much better the vegans of the world can eat without having to harm anyone in the process.  She also talked about how her books differ from the typical animal rights book because she wanted to package it in a fluffy, easy-for-anyone-of-any-educational-background-to-read story so that she could get the message out to the part of the population that would never pick up a book obviously about animal rights.  In this way, she said it could have been called Sneaky Bitch instead of Skinny Bitch.  Her hour interview sold me and I decided that this book seems perfect for my sister (who lives in upstate NY, if that tells you anything) since I have given her plenty of animal rights pamphlets and she won't take one peek at them.  Now who's the sneaky bitch?
Next in the lecture hall was Howard Lyman, whom I have never before had the pleasure of hearing because I either always went to Veg Day on the wrong day (it's an entire weekend event and I only go on one day) or his lecture was at the same time as something else, like a cooking class teaching you how to make raw hummus out of zucchini.  Well, luckily, he was worth the wait.  His quick wit at the age of 65 maybe (?) was coupled with a sense of humor that matches my own, making him the highlight of my day.  If you haven't heard him speak, I highly recommend buying one of his dvds immediately.  Or you can watch a bad bootleg version <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt6vYpILydk">here</a>.
