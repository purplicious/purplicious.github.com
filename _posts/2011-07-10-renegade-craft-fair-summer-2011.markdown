title: "Renegade Craft Fair Summer 2011"
---
Every year at Renegade, we notice a particular theme that is popular at that time. We've seen owls, squirrels, and cupcakes. While we were walking the 3758 miles from our parking spot to Fort Mason, we were trying to make guesses on what would win the title of "most popular theme" this year. As it turned out, it was a tie. Although Eidelyn was convinced that Godzilla was sure to be the winner, he only appeared at one booth (that I noticed), while the main contestants for the prize were anchors, robots, and narwhales. Was there another one??? I can't recall. By the end I could only focus on changing my shoes..haha. However, just when I thought I could focus on nothing other than my ouchy shoes, Zen so politely pointed out these cupcakes, which were the first and only cupcakes I had seen all day (which only served to enforce mine and Eidelyn's theory that donuts are the new cupcake). Aren't they adorbs? And the only thing cuter is that the maker of these babies goes by the name of <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/goodbyebluemonday?section_id=6627414">goodbyebluemonday</a>!!!
