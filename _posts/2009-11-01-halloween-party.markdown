title: "Halloween Party"
---
Every year <a href="http://www.empiricaleducation.com/" target="_blank">my work</a> has a halloween party and orders pizza and we have a potluck and a costume contest, etc.  Every year, for the potluck, I bring something main course-ish so I will have something vegan I can eat.  However, this year is the first year we had <a href="http://www.amicis.com/" target="_blank">Amici's</a> deliver pizza.  For those of you who may not already know, Amici's has a vegan pizza on their menu called the asante and it has daiya cheese on it which is the best vegan cheese I've seen/tasted yet. So, since we ordered vegan pizza, I was able to make halloween cupcakes due to popular demand from my co-workers. Orange and black!
