title: "Cupcakes you can’t eat"
---
Recently Pamela and I attended an <a href="http://ashcanmagazine.com/?p=1330" target="_blank">etsy party in SF</a> where crafters convened in a local bar for our shopping experience.  Everything everyone made was super cute, but of course, the one booth that stood out to me the most was these cute little boxes decorated with beads that looked just like beautiful cupcakes.  The only problem is that they didn't taste like cupcakes.  Not that I tasted them.  Because that would be weird.  But if I did, the chances that they were vegan are pretty high.
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-96" title="cupcake-boxes" src="http://ieatcupcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/cupcake-boxes.jpg" alt="cupcake-boxes" width="420" height="560" /></p>

Sorry the quality was so low, but it was dark in the bar and my camera battery was dead, so I had to use my iPhone.  I also went to the etsy page of the genius who created these beauties, but she has no pictures of them there either.  Sad.  If you want to buy one though, I sure you can use <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/bobbyjane" target="_blank">this etsy page</a> to track her down.
