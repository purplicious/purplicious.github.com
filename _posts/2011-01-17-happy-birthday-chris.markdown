title: "Happy Birthday Chris!"
---
Today is Chris' birthday and luckily he has a Lori in his life that makes him vegan cupcakes on his birthday. Today she used <a href="http://loveveg.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/vanilla-cupcakes/" target="_blank">this recipe</a> and stuck a marshmallow in the batter before baking and it turned out like a volcano. She didn't use icing (which is admittedly not very cupcake-like), but the icing would have hidden the unique volcano quality. Yay for birthdays that involve vegan cupcakes!!!
