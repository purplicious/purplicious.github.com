title: "Hello Kitty Cupcakes"
---
In an effort to further draw out my birthday (regularly occurring annually in May) as noted in the blogpost about <a href="http://www.ieatcupcakes.com/2011/08/18/rilakkuma-cupcakes" target="_blank">Jessica's birthday</a>, we had my final birthday celebration (shared with Lulu's birthday...just one of the few caveats of making your birthday last 4 months) this past weekend under the guise of hello kitty karaoke!

Pandora karaoke may not have the best music selection, but what they lack in musical quality, they make up for in hot chicks that work there and an ultra-cute hello-kitty-themed private karaoke room. Oh, they also search your stuff on your way in so don't try to be too sneaky (or at least not via purse).

In order to prepare for this momentous occasion, I hired cupcake <del datetime="2011-09-01T04:48:14+00:00">slaves</del> elves (correction by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chocolatecupcakes/6095292413" target="_blank">Jocelyn</a>) to assist in the two-day process of making hello-kitty-themed cupcakes.

This music video is brought to you by the policy strictly adhered to by all EY employees that they refer to as the "picture or it didn't happen" policy. In this case, the picture format requested was that of a music video, which Jessica flawlessly provided within moments of the request. I hope that all current and former EY employees request photographic evidence of all cupcake-making adventures forevermore, as it helps my blog become a more multi-dimensional archive of vegan cupcake insanity.

Now that the documentation of cupcake creation has been covered, let's watch the funnest (yes, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=funnest" target="_blank">funnest</a> is a word) part of cupcakes - the devouration! (yes, that's a word too...no need to look it up...put the dictionary down right now! I have a spatula and I'm not afraid to use it.)

Eidelyn is my most talented photographing friend, so needless to say, the following photos are all hers!

If I had a time machine*, I would go back and draw whiskers on Jessica and Virginia because seriously??!!! How effing adorable are they???? It's actually probably best that they didn't have whiskers or I might have mistaken them for cupcakes (and myself for a cat) and licked their cute little faces.

Pamela and I with the peeping hello kitty and of course, cupcakes!

This is what happens when you eat too many hello kitty cupcakes. You start turning into a kitty.

*I would also go back to that time I met that stupid mean boy in my 4th/5th grade combination class who wrote my phone number all over the entirety of Milpitas, causing what seemed like an eternity of prank calls to my house, and I'd have used better judgement in giving out my phone number. If anyone wants to hunt him down, and deliver a punishment, his name was Ed Fletcher. I will repay you in cupcakes....the amount/flavor dependent on the severity of his lashings.
