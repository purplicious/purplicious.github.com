title: "Fun-a-day 31"

Technically, Fun-a-day month is over, but since I started this project and almost completed it before February, I'm going to count it. I've been wanting a cupcake shaped purse for a long time. This one looked a bit cuter in my imagination than real life (like most things) but I think it's a good start. Maybe I'll make it differently next time. I just realized I didn't take any pictures of the inside, with the cupcake lining, but I am so sleepy and still have so much to do to prepare for the art show so this will have to do.
