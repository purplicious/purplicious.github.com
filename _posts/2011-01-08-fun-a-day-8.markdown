title: "Fun-a-day 8"
---
Helllooooooo weekend! So, so very nice to see you. Today I have been engulfed in cupcake land for about 3 hours, and it looks to be about 3 more to go. In addition to being cupcake-a-day #8, it is also the day of Gabe's birthday party. Gabe (well, actually Virginia and Jocelyn) decided on a game themed birthday, which as I understand it, means we will being playing a plethora of board and video games this evening. So, when Virginia and Jocelyn decided on this theme, they emailed the most hilarious PDF of "how to throw a successful game night." This seriously made me laugh so hard when I saw it because it looked like it was scanned from a 1970's version of good housekeeping or some shit. The beginning of the story talked about how it's good to have a color theme for your party, so after inquiring as to what color plate I should be bringing my game-themed snacks on, I discovered that the color theme for the party is blue. So, today I had to run out to the store to get blue cupcake papers because I only had black, pink, purple, red, and white. Now I have blue and green too because Michaels sells their cupcake papers in 2-color sets. I highly recommend getting yours there because 1) they have polka dots on them and everything with polka dots is cute, and 2) they almost always have a 40% off coupon online, so you end up getting 75 cupcake papers for only $1.39.

Soooo....I, for some insane reason, decided to make a <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/voodoo-ronalds-donut-cupcakes-recipe/">cupcake recipe</a> that has 3 parts: the cake, the filling, and the icing. So far, I have made parts 1 &amp; 2. Then in addition to the icing, Jessica and I are going to [attempt to] decorate them with fondant. We are thinking a tetris theme, but we may incorporate some other video/board games into the mix. So, the recipe I'm working on is an altered version of the Vegan Cupcakes Take Over The World recipe called Boston Creme Pie. However, I'm trying to make mine taste less like pie and more like the custard filled donuts that you get at Ronalds and/or Voodoo Donut shops. I love a creme filled donut. And since I can't always go to Portland or Vegas, I'm hoping to create a treat than can satisfy the craving.

...::time elapse::.. So, I made the mistake of taking a nap, and therefore had little time for artistic creativity. Our grandeur plans of making mini fondant dominoes kind of went out the window and we settled a one common theme of our all-time favorite childhood video game, Super Mario Brothers. We got our inspiration from this artistic genius named <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hello_naomi/2207881678" target="_blank">hello naomi</a>.
