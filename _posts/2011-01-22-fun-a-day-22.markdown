I hate owning things that aren't useful. I have never really been one to own knick knack patty whack give a dog a bone...wait, what was I saying? I got distracted. Oh, yeah. So, I don't like having things sitting around collecting dust. So, the cupcake I made yesterday needed to be turned into something extraordinary. Isabelle had the idea of a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jessicaspacekat/5381147721" target="_blank">cupcake flip watch</a> and I didn't realize how difficult the engineering would be on this. Luckily, Douglas came up with this plan or who knows how badly this would've turned out.
