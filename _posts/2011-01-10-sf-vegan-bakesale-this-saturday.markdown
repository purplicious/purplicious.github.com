title: "SF Vegan Bakesale this Saturday"
---
If you live near San Francisco (or you don't but have airline miles to waste on stuffing baked goods into your mouth) and want to try yummy baked goods while helping to support animals, you should come to the bakesale this Saturday. I'll be bringing some of the cupcakes featured in my post from 2 days ago...
