title: "Fox & Fawn, how cute are you?"

This vegan bakery is apparently located nearby in the vicinity of the northeast bay area and their <a href="http://foxandfawn.com/home.html" target="_blank">website</a> makes me want to redesign mine asap. Jessica and Josipa, can we go back to having dev night once a week? Pleeease! If <a href="http://foxandfawn.com/home.html" target="_blank">this</a> isn't inspiration, I don't know what can be. Except maybe <a href="http://ipap.me/" target="_blank">this</a>. Because honestly, who doesn't love the idea of getting their annual pap smear through the internet.
