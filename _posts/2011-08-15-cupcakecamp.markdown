David found this because it's bears a resemblance to some nerdy-open-source-project-thingie that he's always getting himself into. I don't know much about it, except that it will be people eating cupcakes, which hopefully will include some baked (and eaten) by me (and hopefully you)!  If anyone is interested in going to this with me to sample cupcakes, or just baking/decorating with me, let me know because this sounds like it could potentially be awesome (as long as it has nothing to do with camping...or the outdoors...or bugs).

<a href="http://cupcakecamp.org/" target="_blank">CupcakeCamp</a> will be held on Sunday, October 23rd, 2011 from 2-5pm (but really? will cupcakes last that long??? I think not!)
