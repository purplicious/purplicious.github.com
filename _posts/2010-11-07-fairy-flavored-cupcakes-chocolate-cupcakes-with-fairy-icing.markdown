title: "Fairy Flavored Cupcakes (Chocolate Cupcakes with Fairy Icing)"
---
Bradley is coming into town, and it became a tradition to regale him with cupcakes since the last time he came to Sacramento with the Deftones.

I asked him what flavor he wanted, and he simply stated that he wants my specialty - which is, of course, chocolate.

I chose a vanilla fairy icing, because most people are allergic to fairy icing (the most common symptom is that your ears become pointy). But Bradley has an immunity to all high-allergen foods, so he will be just fine.
