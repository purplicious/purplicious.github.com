title: "Death by Chocolate"

When I first read the "closed" sign at Edible Flours after taking a bus for the sole purpose of trying the vegan truffles and stuffed cupcakes, my first reaction was sadness and my second inclination was to vandalize the exterior of their business. How could they be closed after I traveled by plane from California for their cupcakes? It brought back memories of that time that Jocelyn and I walked forever in Portland for vegan soft serve (on this very weekend 2 years ago), only to end in me staring through glass to a desolate let-down. After the disappointment waned, and I hopped on a bus back to gastown, I hopped off the bus to transfer and low and behold, I was in front of a place called death by chocolate! What better way to die???? There isn't one...trust me. I was preparing myself for the disappointment of there being nothing vegan for me, when my spirits were pleasantly lifted! Vegan chocolate cupcakes!!!!
