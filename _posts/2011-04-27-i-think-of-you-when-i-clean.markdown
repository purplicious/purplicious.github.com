This is what she tells me in an email accompanying this picture of the cutest paper towels in the entire world. Well, this planet at least. These seriously make me want to go and clean her house. Which would be considered weird in most circles. But, even with this inordinate longing to clean her house, it doesn't surprise me in the least that her disposable cleaning products are cuter than my non-disposable ones, because in case you don't already know <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/soundinwater/sets/72157594237590117/">Bardot</a>, everything she owns is cute!
