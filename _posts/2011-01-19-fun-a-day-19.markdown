This was the perfect day for ShojoPop night for a multitude of reasons. The first reason being thatÂ I got my new camera in the mail today! And not only that, but after many failed attempts at trying to figure out how to use my new eye-fi card with my new camera, I really needed to make something ultra-cute and candy/cupcake-esque to make myself feel better about my ineptness with technology. I think this camera case proves to the world that you don't have to be good with technology as long as you can make cute cases for your technological items. And can I just reiterate how much I love love love things that are reversible?! Now I have a camera case that matches <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/2010/07/12/cupcake-apron/">Melissa's apron</a>! Not only is the case itself reversible, but the pink ribbon has beads that are reversed from the order of the blue ribbon. Oh, how I love the asymmetry!

Thank you Eidelyn for taking the cutest pictures ever even though it's almost midnight on a school night!!!
