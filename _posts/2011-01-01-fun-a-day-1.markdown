So...now that we only have a few minutes left in the day, I am happy to announce that I have completed day one of cupcake-a-day! It wasn't easy due to my many injuries I managed to acquire last night in my state-of-bringing-in-the-new-year. So, I hobbled around the house and managed with my blistered feet, slashed shoulder, and gouged knuckle to produce not one, but two felt cupcake luggage tags. Just what you've always wanted right? Can you just imagine how easy it will be to tell your costco black suitcase from everyone else's when it rolls out on the belt wearing a stylish cupcake? Mhm.
