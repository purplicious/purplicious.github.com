title: "Slumber party 2010"
---
My beloved friends had a slumber party in my honor last night including all the necessary components of a fabulous slumber party: sangria (duh), mani-pedis, face masks, movies, ordering pizza (thank goodness for Amici's-slumber parties across the bay area just got better), and of course, decorating cupcakes. Did I mention eating cupcakes?
