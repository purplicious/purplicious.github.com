Welcome to cupcake-a-day #5. I have not yet failed, but tomorrow will be the ultimate test because I'll be attending the <a href="http://www.mocfa.org/craftbar/index.htm" target="_blank">etsy craft lab</a> in hopes of finding something I can make that will somehow be related to cupcakes. It might take a bit of imagination on your part, but if I can think up 31 cupcake-related activities this month, the least you can do is get off your ass and use a little imagination. It's not like I'm asking you to make anything. Pshh. But that's tomorrow. To quote Zen, let's focus on the present, shall we. And the present is that I spent about four hours (ok, ok, some of that four hours may have been spent eating cupcakes, booking emerald con flights to Seattle, and looking through my wardrobe) making cupcake shoe bows this evening. In my mind, I'm envisioning these shoe bows on my china flats (aka Kung Fu shoes, according to Douglas), but when discussing my emerald con packing list, I will only be bringing boots so as to minimize complaints of frozen toes. How can I put shoe bows on boots???!!! ::sigh::

I would like to thank Eidelyn for being my photographer this evening (with her slew of fancy camera apps on her phone), as I was busy earning a spot in vegan hell by slaying an extended family of ants in my kitchen. That's what happens in this house if you try to eat one of my cupcakes without asking.* Anyone else want to challenge me? I didn't think so. It was the last cupcake too. ::visualize my sad face here with the bottom lip protruding::Â  How about some pictures of shoe bows to cheer us up?

*Exception: Dexter ate a cupcake off the arm of the couch once (paper and all-such a barbarian), and he is still alive.
