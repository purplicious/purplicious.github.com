I've never owned napkin rings before because a) I rarely need a napkin because I eat so fast that by the time I realize I need one, I'm done and I just wash my hands and b) similar to reason a, I don't do a lot of sitting at the table with my napkin in a ring because the second my butt hits the chair, I'm shoveling food into my mouth. In fact, sometimes (you can ask the people I work with for proof), I start shoveling it in before I even get to my seat while walking. That's what a piggie I am. However, the fact that napkin rings are unnecessary hasn't kept me from admiring other (non-piggie) people's napkin rings and wondering if I would ever grow up and have some of my very own. I got tired of waiting for that to happen, so I just decided to make some. I may never use them. I may give them away. I may list them on <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/ShojoPop" target="_blank">etsy</a>. But at least now I can say, that I pretended to be a sophisticated-napkin-ring-owning individual for at least a week. These photos are a sad reality of how bad I am at sculpting. This is the reason that I put Jessica in charge of fondant tasks. The funniest (and when I say funniest, I really mean most symbolic of my inept sculpting ability, aka lack thereof) part of this cupcake-a-day #18 project is that unlike 99.85% of the population who improve with practice, my best napkin ring of the night was the first one I did. It actually looks like a cupcake. The second through fourth look like weird midget ice cream cones. Can you guess which one I made first?* Apparently I undergo the reverse of practice makes perfect. Which would be perfect makes practice? Ummm...I think it's past my bedtime.
