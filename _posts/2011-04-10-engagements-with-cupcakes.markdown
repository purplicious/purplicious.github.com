title: "Engagements with cupcakes"
---
All ceremonious events should be adorned with cupcakes, which is why when Jocelyn asked me to bake cupcakes for her engagement party, I of course said...make Davy do it...what are husband-to-bes for? Kidding of course! I happily obliged because weekends are for partying partying yeah...sorry...blame Douglas for playing the metal version of Friday moments ago...damn that horribly catchy and sadistic song. I mostly obliged because I wanted an excuse to eat cupcakes, but partially obliged because Jocelyn and Davy are adorable and deserve the cutest cupcakes ever and not to toot my own horn, but I make the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jessicaspacekat/5609001128/" target="_blank">cutest cupcakes ever</a>. These are just my basic <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/chocolate-cupcakes/">chocolate cupcake recipe</a> with <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/vanilla-buttercream-icing/">vanilla buttercream icing</a>.
