During the time Marcie worked with me, I never realized that an adult could eat so much peanut butter and jelly. She was more obsessed with these sandwiches than a child. I never understood the appeal really. I like my food savory and my sweets ultra-sweet. I'm not down with fruit in my salad or lightly sweetened desserts. So, while I was preparing for Marcie's birthday celebration (aka. picking out bows), I was trying to figure out a way to make a peanut butter and jelly sound good to me. My conclusion was to take away the bread, add chocolate (there's really no point in eating anything that doesn't involve chocolate), and pump up the sweetness. Behold the Peanut Butter and Jelly chocolate cupcake! It's basically just the <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/e-t-cupcake-recipe/">E.T. cupcake recipe</a>, but with strawberry preserves injected in the center. Jessica kindly recorded the injection process, but it was more out of disgust than awe. Regardless of her intentions, now there will be no question as to how to make these delicious cupcakes. Warning: If you are prone to motion sickness (or injection sickness), you may choose to skip this (not so) entertaining movie.

The icing didn't come out as pretty as I had hoped because I decided to try to use mostly peanut butter and very little shortening or earth balance. Marcie is a personal trainer, so I knew she wouldn't want a lot of fat in her birthday cupcakes. If you follow the recipe exactly, your icing with be much prettier.

Here's the birthday girl with (what's left of) her cupcakes.
