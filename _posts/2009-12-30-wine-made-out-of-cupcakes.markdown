title: "Wine made out of cupcakes?"
---
I was pretty confident that I wouldn't come across any vegan cupcakes while visiting my mom in BFE, I mean Bonita Springs, Florida. So, I hadn't even entertained the prospect of being given a chance to post on my cute little vegan cupcake blog.  However, leave it to me to spot the only cupcake within a 50 mile radius.  I was shopping with my mommy at this place that resembles a grocery outlet called Dixie's (read my review of it <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/dixie-liquidation-groceries-bonita-springs#hrid:9HoJRra679FVkg4CPCOsfQ" target="_blank">here</a>), when I spotted the massiveness of its icing:

<p style="text-align: center;">I looked closer only to realize that this cupcake was not only inedible, but likely not made of vegan ingredients.  However, it topped a cupcake stand that beheld vegan wine from a winery in Monterrey called Cupcake winery! How have I not discovered this place before??? Oh yeah, I know why.  Whenever I'm in Monterrey, it's for the sole purpose of looking at cute swimming creatures.  Way more important than wine. However, in the absence of culture and the void of anything cool (in Bonita Springs, FL), this vegan cupcake wine is the best thing I've discovered so far.  The downside: you may need to sit down for this.  The wine is not really made out of cupcakes. I'm sorry I had to be the one to tell you. It disappointed me as well. If you still want to give it a chance, knowing it has no cupcakes in it, here's a closer look at the label:</p>
