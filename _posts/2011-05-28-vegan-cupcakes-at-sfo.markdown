title: "Vegan cupcakes at SFO"
---
when I first heard that virgin airlines changed to a different terminal, I wasn't excited due to my resistance to change. However, now that I'm living the good life in terminal 2, I'm instantly warmed to the change. the food court has a plant cafe with vegan banana bread and 2 kinds of vegan cupcakes!!!!
