Following the rule that everyone who has ever known me knows about birthdays, I inquired as to what type of birthday cake Zen would like for his 14th birthday. Typical to his undying attempts to prove his uniqueness, his request was none other than a gigantic pina colada cupcake. I, of course, had to invent this recipe since I pretty much only make chocolate cupcakes with chocolate icing and chocolate drizzle, because why bother making non-chocolate desserts? At least that is what my theory was before tasting this recipe. In an effort to not promote underage drinking, this recipe is actually the cupcake version of a virgin pina colada. Booooorrrring. 

Here's a time-series photo montage of Isabelle decorating the cake.
