Next weekend in the mission...vegan cupcake sale (and I guess for some reason they choose to allow other baked goods to enter the premises) that all proceeds go to awesome causes. What more could you ask for? That yours truly will be providing some cute and decadent cupcakes that you will not only want to sink your teeth into, but also possible rub all over your body (and the bodies of cute life partners)? Well, then, you're in luck! But I won't tell you what I'll be making because it's a surprise...or maybe because I haven't decided yet...and if it's the latter, I may be open to suggestion, so feel free to try to persuade me to make your favorite recipe.
