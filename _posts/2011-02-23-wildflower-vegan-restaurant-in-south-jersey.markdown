title: "Wildflower Vegan Restaurant in South Jersey"
---
Melissa finally opened her very own vegan cafe! She just missed the mark a tad by opening it on the wrong side of the country, but I'm hoping that it will get so popular that she will have to expand and open a branch here. Then I can quit my job and become a cupcake artist full-time at her bay area branch with her while she has Andrea run her South Jersey branch.

If you live in or near South Jersey or have friends/relatives who do, make sure everyone knows about this place because the only thing Melissa does better than cook is make babies (I am by no means implying that baby making is on the menu; it was just a comparison. Although, if the price is right, then email me and we might be able to work something out. shhh...)

Here's her <a href="http://www.thedailyjournal.com/article/20110218/NEWS01/102180308/Vegan-eatery-opens-Millville">feature in the paper</a>, her <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/wildflower-earthly-vegan-fare-millville">yelp</a>, and the <a href="http://wildflowervegan.com/">link to the menu</a> (I know her website needs help and if I were a good friend, I would assist in that department, but instead I opted to make her the cute apron that she's wearing in the photo.) If you happen to glance <a href="http://wildflowervegan.com/archive/Wildflower%20Bi-Fold%202-20.pdf">this week's menu</a>, they have (I'll try not to scream this) butternut cupcakes!!!! I'm getting hungry just thinking about them.
