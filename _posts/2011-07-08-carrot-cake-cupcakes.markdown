title: "Carrot Cake Cupcakes!"
---
Why have I never thought to make <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/carrot-cupcakes-recipe/">carrot cake cupcakes</a> before? Did I forget how delicious carrot cake was? Is it the lack of chocolatey goodness in them that my aversion, forgetfulness, or avoidance stems from? I don't think anyone really knows the answer to these questions, however, I must say that carrot cake cupcakes might just be the new chocolate cupcake for me. I made these for the first time in celebration of Eidelyn's birthday. The craft girls all nominated me to be the delivery girl; not because I look like kiki the delivery witch (although I did after my stylist freshly dyed my hair black the weekend before), but because I work in Palo Alto, the closest to Redwood City (workplace of the birthday girl).

Because I have no need to make test tube babies (Who in their right mind would have children on purpose?!), I hadn't actually ever been to Eidelyn's place of employment before this delivery day. So, when I arrived at what google maps (a.k.a. lying-ass-maps) told me was the correct location, I parked and got out with cupcakes and homemade cards in hand, ready to kiki it up. This is where my day started going a little haywire. So, because Eidelyn is a fancy sort of girl, I had dressed up that day and even worn heels! I know, I know, the real kiki didn't wear heels, but I'm like the grown up version of kiki, who traded in her shoes and broom for heels and a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">unicorn</span> Prius. So, here's the funny part. Eidelyn's work wasn't actually on middlefield road, like the address suggests. So, I walked (in heels, don't forget) over these rocky train tracks and through an enormous parking lot in search of her work. Once I finally found it, probably with sweat sticking my baby hairs to my forehead in an oh-so-attractive-and-negating-the-point-of-dressing-nice kind of way, I knocked on the door and was greeted by some very helpful co-workers who informed me that Eidelyn wasn't at work that day due to Jury Duty!!!!

Sooooo....because I traded in my broom, I was forced to walk all the way back to my car, still carrying birthday treats, and waded through the rocky highlands (train tracks) yet again. Long story short, by the time I finally reached Eidelyn's house and banged the door knocker against the house numerous times, I was so exhausted that I had to leave only 11 cupcakes on her porch, because without the sustenance provided by that twelfth cupcake, I may have never made it back to work.

It was all worth it though when she found <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/soundinwater/5889102542">her treats</a> and sent me the best string of emojis that ever existed.
