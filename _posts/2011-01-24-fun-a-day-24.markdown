title: "Fun-a-day 24"
---
The idea of making cupcake napkins was a combination of jocelyn telling me that it would be cute to display the napkin rings on cupcake napkins and our recent visit to crown and crumpet. I haven't uploaded the 253 pictures of cute cupcake things that I spotted while at crown &amp; crumpet yet, but one of them was cupcake napkins. So...cupcake-a-day #24 was dedicated to 4 pink cupcake napkins.
