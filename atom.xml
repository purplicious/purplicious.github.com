    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Please excuse any <del>misinformation</del> lies in this posting, but these cupcakes were made, eaten, and discussed approximately 387465 days ago, and that in conjunction with having a memory equivalent of a snail&#8217;s, makes my rendition of this story almost guaranteed to be slightly different than real life.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there was a super sweet, amazing girl named Amber. Amber was having a rough week, and therefore in need of some cheerful (but not too cheerful) cupcakes. That was how the &#8220;blueberry&#8221; cupcakes were born. I thought that blue cupcakes would be fitting since Amber had been feeling blue, and everyone (everyone = me) wants a cupcake to sympathize with them by matching their mood, right? So, what Eidelyn and I learned after presenting people with these chocolate cupcakes topped with blue vanilla icing, was that humans associate colors with flavors. And the flavor that our human friends associate with blue is blueberry. So, then we wondered if we let them think it was blueberry, would their mind control win in a battle against their taste buds, leading them to believe that the cupcakes were indeed blueberry, when they were only vanilla. Some people might think it was a mean trick to treat their friends like lab rats by performing social experiments on them, but everyone already knows that I&#8217;m mean, and Eidelyn will basically sacrifice all of her morals in the name of science. So, basically those people would be wrong. Yay science!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Virginia had the most amazing idea of making cupcake (and other sweets, if you believe in those) hair accessories, and since I had just moved into my new dollhouse, we decided to make it a cupcake-themed dollhousewarming party. I know, I know, I should have thought of something more original&#8230;.if I have to go to another cupcake-themed dollhousewarming party, I will seriously rip my hair out. Well, mediocrity is just the theme of my life&#8230;if you don&#8217;t like it, don&#8217;t read about it.</p>

<p>In addition to making hair accessories, we also had the option of decorating cupcakes to match our hair creation. I&#8217;m not sure what happened to the rest of the photographs from this event. There may have been one of my first hair accessory, which was a 3D cupcake on a headband, but it was so ugly that I asked Zen to hide it forever, which ended up turning into a fun game of him laughing everytime he saw it, and me wishing I had burned it on a stake. Luckily, no photographic evidence remains of that failed attempt, and I still had plenty of time to make the smallish cupcake bow featured in this lovely photo taken by Josipa.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apparently, cupcakes are the new apple because Isabelle insisted on bringing cupcakes to school on the first day of 4th grade. Kylene (former 2nd grade teacher) said that this tactic was a good one, because not only are cupcakes wayyyyy better than apples (those might not have been the exact words she used), but it would ensure that Isabelle will be well-liked by all the cupcake-eating nine-year-olds. I suggested the idea of making cupcake minis for numerous reasons including 1) the children are mini and therefore their cupcakes should match, 2) making 29 full-sized cupcakes means tripling the batch, which is just ridiculous, and 3) I figured for the teacher&#8217;s first day back after summer break, she might not appreciate having a class full of children drugged on high quantities of sugar.
So, Isabelle chose chocolate cupcakes with mint icing. Over the course of 2 nights, she made all the cupcakes herself and was ultra excited to use the piping bag to ice them for her very first time.

    <link href="http://purplicious.github.com/blog/2011/08/31/hello-kitty-cupcakes/"/>
    <updated>2011-08-31T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://purplicious.github.com/blog/2011/08/31/hello-kitty-cupcakes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In an effort to further draw out my birthday (regularly occurring annually in May) as noted in the blogpost about <a href="http://www.ieatcupcakes.com/2011/08/18/rilakkuma-cupcakes" target="_blank">Jessica&#8217;s birthday</a>, we had my final birthday celebration (shared with Lulu&#8217;s birthday&#8230;just one of the few caveats of making your birthday last 4 months) this past weekend under the guise of hello kitty karaoke!</p>

<p>Pandora karaoke may not have the best music selection, but what they lack in musical quality, they make up for in hot chicks that work there and an ultra-cute hello-kitty-themed private karaoke room. Oh, they also search your stuff on your way in so don&#8217;t try to be too sneaky (or at least not via purse).</p>

<p>In order to prepare for this momentous occasion, I hired cupcake <del datetime="2011-09-01T04:48:14+00:00">slaves</del> elves (correction by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chocolatecupcakes/6095292413" target="_blank">Jocelyn</a>) to assist in the two-day process of making hello-kitty-themed cupcakes.</p>

<p>This music video is brought to you by the policy strictly adhered to by all EY employees that they refer to as the &#8220;picture or it didn&#8217;t happen&#8221; policy. In this case, the picture format requested was that of a music video, which Jessica flawlessly provided within moments of the request. I hope that all current and former EY employees request photographic evidence of all cupcake-making adventures forevermore, as it helps my blog become a more multi-dimensional archive of vegan cupcake insanity.</p>

<iframe width="460" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/gKH_oeH8CTw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Now that the documentation of cupcake creation has been covered, let&#8217;s watch the funnest (yes, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=funnest" target="_blank">funnest</a> is a word) part of cupcakes - the devouration! (yes, that&#8217;s a word too&#8230;no need to look it up&#8230;put the dictionary down right now! I have a spatula and I&#8217;m not afraid to use it.)</p>

<p>Eidelyn is my most talented photographing friend, so needless to say, the following photos are all hers!
<a href="http://http://www.flickr.com/photos/chocolatecupcakes/6102354944" rel="Hello Kitty cupcakes"><img src="http://ieatcupcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cupcakes1-510x340.jpg" alt="Hello Kitty cupcakes" title="Hello Kitty cupcakes" width="510" height="340" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1024" /></a></p>

<p>If I had a time machine*, I would go back and draw whiskers on Jessica and Virginia because seriously??!!! How effing adorable are they???? It&#8217;s actually probably best that they didn&#8217;t have whiskers or I might have mistaken them for cupcakes (and myself for a cat) and licked their cute little faces.</p>

<p><a href="http://http://www.flickr.com/photos/chocolatecupcakes/6102354198" rel="Jessica and Virginia"><img src="http://ieatcupcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Jessica-Virginia-510x340.jpg" alt="Jessica and Virginia" title="Jessica and Virginia" width="510" height="340" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1025" /></a></p>

<p>Pamela and I with the peeping hello kitty and of course, cupcakes!</p>

<p><a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/?attachment_id=1035" rel="Pamela and Robin"><img src="http://ieatcupcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/cupcakes-Pam-me-510x510.jpg" alt="Pamela and Robin" title="Pamela and Robin" width="510" height="510" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1035" /></a></p>

<p>This is what happens when you eat too many hello kitty cupcakes. You start turning into a kitty.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chocolatecupcakes/6102393844" rel="Hello Kitty karaoke"><img src="http://ieatcupcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/groupshot-510x340.jpg" alt="Hello Kitty karaoke" title="Hello Kitty karaoke" width="510" height="340" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1030" /></a></p>

<p>*I would also go back to that time I met that stupid mean boy in my 4th/5th grade combination class who wrote my phone number all over the entirety of Milpitas, causing what seemed like an eternity of prank calls to my house, and I&#8217;d have used better judgement in giving out my phone number. If anyone wants to hunt him down, and deliver a punishment, his name was Ed Fletcher. I will repay you in cupcakes&#8230;.the amount/flavor dependent on the severity of his lashings.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During the time Marcie worked with me, I never realized that an adult could eat so much peanut butter and jelly. She was more obsessed with these sandwiches than a child. I never understood the appeal really. I like my food savory and my sweets ultra-sweet. I&#8217;m not down with fruit in my salad or lightly sweetened desserts. So, while I was preparing for Marcie&#8217;s birthday celebration (aka. picking out bows), I was trying to figure out a way to make a peanut butter and jelly sound good to me. My conclusion was to take away the bread, add chocolate (there&#8217;s really no point in eating anything that doesn&#8217;t involve chocolate), and pump up the sweetness. Behold the Peanut Butter and Jelly chocolate cupcake! It&#8217;s basically just the <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/e-t-cupcake-recipe/">E.T. cupcake recipe</a>, but with strawberry preserves injected in the center. Jessica kindly recorded the injection process, but it was more out of disgust than awe. Regardless of her intentions, now there will be no question as to how to make these delicious cupcakes. Warning: If you are prone to motion sickness (or injection sickness), you may choose to skip this (not so) entertaining movie.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/UJ9aPV9JbEE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>The icing didn&#8217;t come out as pretty as I had hoped because I decided to try to use mostly peanut butter and very little shortening or earth balance. Marcie is a personal trainer, so I knew she wouldn&#8217;t want a lot of fat in her birthday cupcakes. If you follow the recipe exactly, your icing with be much prettier.</p>

    <id>http://purplicious.github.com/blog/2011/08/18/rilakkuma-cupcakes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-965" href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/2011/08/18/rilakkuma-cupcakes/rc/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-965" title="Rilakkuma Cupcakes" src="http://ieatcupcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/rc-510x500.jpg" alt="" width="510" height="500" /></a>
Jessica (like myself) is pretty good at drawing out the whole birthday thing to get as much mileage out of it as possible. She&#8217;ll never be as good as I am at this, but she can always strive for my status.*  Being the good student that she is, Jessica had a super fun adventure on her birthday week that involved a scavenger hunt each day with fun games such as this one:
<a rel="attachment wp-att-960" href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/2011/08/18/rilakkuma-cupcakes/puzzle/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-960" title="scavenger-hunt" src="http://ieatcupcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/puzzle-408x510.png" alt="" width="408" height="510" /></a></p>

<p>And on the final day, she received a super cute rilakkuma soap dispenser for all her hard work during her birthday week.</p>

<p>Then, true to the milking-a-birthday-for-all-it&#8217;s-worth mentality, she got to have a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chocolatecupcakes/sets/72157627425671870/with/6048653362/" target="_blank">birthday party</a> 2 weeks after her birthday! It was a super fun and crazy party, one in which I did not want to leave, but luckily, Lulu and Randy (thank you guys!) were ready to go at a reasonable hour so I was able to wake up in the morning and drag myself out of bed to take my mommy to brunch in SF. The best part of the entire party was when Jessica made the rule that all cupcakes had to be eaten in a lady-and-the-tramp-pasta-scene style. Oh, the fun! The best ones are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chocolatecupcakes/6039779820/in/set-72157627425671870">here</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chocolatecupcakes/6048100777/in/set-72157627425671870">here</a>.</p>

<p>This post is all out of order. So, let&#8217;s get into a DeLorean and go back to the day of Jessica&#8217;s party when we were at Great America all day, and around 5 something I remembered that I was supposed to make cupcakes for her party! So, we raced home, and I baked the fastest batch of <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/e-t-cupcake-recipe/">peanut butter chocolate cupcakes</a> that I have ever baked in my life. I got home at 6:15pm and Lulu and Randy were coming at 7:30pm to pick me up. I still needed to shower and get ready for the party, make dinner for the family, eat (this is important because whenever I drink without eating dinner, bad bad things happen), and make and decorate the cupcakes. There was no way I would have gotten all of this done without my child-mom-slave labor camp I employ. Look at them hard at work!</p>

<p>Here is the final result after the attack:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>David found this because it&#8217;s bears a resemblance to some nerdy-open-source-project-thingie that he&#8217;s always getting himself into. I don&#8217;t know much about it, except that it will be people eating cupcakes, which hopefully will include some baked (and eaten) by me (and hopefully you)!  If anyone is interested in going to this with me to sample cupcakes, or just baking/decorating with me, let me know because this sounds like it could potentially be awesome (as long as it has nothing to do with camping&#8230;or the outdoors&#8230;or bugs).</p>

<p><a href="http://cupcakecamp.org/" target="_blank">CupcakeCamp</a> will be held on Sunday, October 23rd, 2011 from 2-5pm (but really? will cupcakes last that long??? I think not!)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every year at Renegade, we notice a particular theme that is popular at that time. We&#8217;ve seen owls, squirrels, and cupcakes. While we were walking the 3758 miles from our parking spot to Fort Mason, we were trying to make guesses on what would win the title of &#8220;most popular theme&#8221; this year. As it turned out, it was a tie. Although Eidelyn was convinced that Godzilla was sure to be the winner, he only appeared at one booth (that I noticed), while the main contestants for the prize were anchors, robots, and narwhales. Was there another one??? I can&#8217;t recall. By the end I could only focus on changing my shoes..haha. However, just when I thought I could focus on nothing other than my ouchy shoes, Zen so politely pointed out these cupcakes, which were the first and only cupcakes I had seen all day (which only served to enforce mine and Eidelyn&#8217;s theory that donuts are the new cupcake). Aren&#8217;t they adorbs? And the only thing cuter is that the maker of these babies goes by the name of <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/goodbyebluemonday?section_id=6627414">goodbyebluemonday</a>!!!</p>

    <link href="http://purplicious.github.com/blog/2011/07/08/carrot-cake-cupcakes/"/>
    <updated>2011-07-08T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://purplicious.github.com/blog/2011/07/08/carrot-cake-cupcakes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Why have I never thought to make <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/carrot-cupcakes-recipe/">carrot cake cupcakes</a> before? Did I forget how delicious carrot cake was? Is it the lack of chocolatey goodness in them that my aversion, forgetfulness, or avoidance stems from? I don&#8217;t think anyone really knows the answer to these questions, however, I must say that carrot cake cupcakes might just be the new chocolate cupcake for me. I made these for the first time in celebration of Eidelyn&#8217;s birthday. The craft girls all nominated me to be the delivery girl; not because I look like kiki the delivery witch (although I did after my stylist freshly dyed my hair black the weekend before), but because I work in Palo Alto, the closest to Redwood City (workplace of the birthday girl).</p>

<p>Because I have no need to make test tube babies (Who in their right mind would have children on purpose?!), I hadn&#8217;t actually ever been to Eidelyn&#8217;s place of employment before this delivery day. So, when I arrived at what google maps (a.k.a. lying-ass-maps) told me was the correct location, I parked and got out with cupcakes and homemade cards in hand, ready to kiki it up. This is where my day started going a little haywire. So, because Eidelyn is a fancy sort of girl, I had dressed up that day and even worn heels! I know, I know, the real kiki didn&#8217;t wear heels, but I&#8217;m like the grown up version of kiki, who traded in her shoes and broom for heels and a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">unicorn</span> Prius. So, here&#8217;s the funny part. Eidelyn&#8217;s work wasn&#8217;t actually on middlefield road, like the address suggests. So, I walked (in heels, don&#8217;t forget) over these rocky train tracks and through an enormous parking lot in search of her work. Once I finally found it, probably with sweat sticking my baby hairs to my forehead in an oh-so-attractive-and-negating-the-point-of-dressing-nice kind of way, I knocked on the door and was greeted by some very helpful co-workers who informed me that Eidelyn wasn&#8217;t at work that day due to Jury Duty!!!!</p>

<p>Sooooo&#8230;.because I traded in my broom, I was forced to walk all the way back to my car, still carrying birthday treats, and waded through the rocky highlands (train tracks) yet again. Long story short, by the time I finally reached Eidelyn&#8217;s house and banged the door knocker against the house numerous times, I was so exhausted that I had to leave only 11 cupcakes on her porch, because without the sustenance provided by that twelfth cupcake, I may have never made it back to work.</p>

<p>It was all worth it though when she found <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/soundinwater/5889102542">her treats</a> and sent me the best string of emojis that ever existed.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I first read the &#8220;closed&#8221; sign at Edible Flours after taking a bus for the sole purpose of trying the vegan truffles and stuffed cupcakes, my first reaction was sadness and my second inclination was to vandalize the exterior of their business. How could they be closed after I traveled by plane from California for their cupcakes? It brought back memories of that time that Jocelyn and I walked forever in Portland for vegan soft serve (on this very weekend 2 years ago), only to end in me staring through glass to a desolate let-down. After the disappointment waned, and I hopped on a bus back to gastown, I hopped off the bus to transfer and low and behold, I was in front of a place called death by chocolate! What better way to die???? There isn&#8217;t one&#8230;trust me. I was preparing myself for the disappointment of there being nothing vegan for me, when my spirits were pleasantly lifted! Vegan chocolate cupcakes!!!!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>These <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/mint-cookies-n-cream-cupcakes/">vegan mint cookies n cream cupcakes</a> are a Robin and Isabelle rendition of the cookies n cream cupcake recipe in Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World (VCTOTW).  For those of you who had the pleasure of visiting Maggie Mudd before they decided to break the hearts of vegans all over the world (well, maybe just in the San Francisco bay area), you may know why the vegan mint cookies n cream ice cream flavor would entice someone to make a cupcake version of it. It&#8217;s basically amazing. And luckily, Colby had a birthday recently, and the exquisite Katie got him the raddest World of Warcraft ice cream cake ever from Maggie Mudd (yes, they haven&#8217;t completely sold us out&#8230;they are still offering ridiculously priced vegan ice cream cakes for you die-hard fans out there)! Instead of going into the details of the cake design being a timeline of all of Colby&#8217;s current and past WOW characters, I will instead describe the deliciousness that is the mint cookies n cream ice cream that was enveloped by a brownie crust and the most delicious whipped topping icing I have ever experienced (I must get more info on this stuff from Violet asap). So, in lieu of ordering a $2749674 cake this evening, Isabelle and I decided to make <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/mint-cookies-n-cream-cupcakes/">these</a> instead.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever thought to yourself, &#8220;I have the best friends in the entire world?&#8221; Well, you would be wrong, because my friends are the best in the whole world, making yours second best. That&#8217;s how ranking works. I know this because I recently started using the rank function in excel for our coffee club at work. I have also learned that if two kinds of coffee have the same ranking (and therefore are tied), then the following ranking skips a number. So, I believe that currently the peaberry from bluebottle and the hair bender from stumptown are in a tie for position 2. That means that the next highest score is ranked 4. Mhm. I&#8217;m basically the ranking expert, so unless you are part of my friend circle, you cannot possible have better friends than the ones I have. And why are my friends so awesome, you ask? Besides the obvious reasons (including their cute factor, their ability-to-put-up-with-me factor, and their fun factor), they also happen to know how to plan the most amazing events! Last weekend is a prime example of this unprecedented skill of theirs. Last weekend, they planned the most amazing of all amazing brunches ever&#8230;.</p>

<p>Vegan Cupcake and Coffee Brunch! You might think that this is not much of a feat, considering there&#8217;s no &#8220;real&#8221; food involved, but considering I am the only vegan in the group, and that this was the first attempt at vegan baking for many of them (first attempt at any baking for one of them), this was basically the best thing ever!</p>

<p>When Amber heard about the cupcake brunch, she suggested there may be too much sweet for one brunch, so Pam and I responded to her concern with pizza cupcakes and spinach and mushroom quiche cupcakes with sun-dried tomato cream cheese icing, in an (inane) effort to have a healthy option.</p>
