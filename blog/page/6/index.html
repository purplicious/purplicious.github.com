  <div class="entry-content"><p>I hate owning things that aren&#8217;t useful. I have never really been one to own knick knack patty whack give a dog a bone&#8230;wait, what was I saying? I got distracted. Oh, yeah. So, I don&#8217;t like having things sitting around collecting dust. So, the cupcake I made yesterday needed to be turned into something extraordinary. Isabelle had the idea of a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jessicaspacekat/5381147721" target="_blank">cupcake flip watch</a> and I didn&#8217;t realize how difficult the engineering would be on this. Luckily, Douglas came up with this plan or who knows how badly this would&#8217;ve turned out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>cupcake-a-day #20 has an element of secrecy. it&#8217;s kind of one of those for me to know and you to find out things. as soon as there is no danger of being discovered, I will post photos, accompanied by an explanation.</p>

<p>So&#8230;here we are a few days after the secret post. I&#8217;m sure nobody has been losing sleep over this, but it&#8217;s time to reveal the big secret. So, for a few months, we were planning a surprise half-birthday party* for Jessica and my cupcake project for Thursday night was to make cupcake coasters as party favors for the party. In fear of her reading the blog and me spoiling part or all of the surprise, I had to leave my post unfinished. The coasters we Pamela&#8217;s idea since we were having a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chocolatecupcakes/5383749934/" target="_blank">tea party for Jessica</a>, it made perfect sense to have <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jocelyntran/5381582036" target="_blank">the coasters</a> as the souvenir.</p>

<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-547" href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/2011/01/20/fun-a-day-20/coasters2/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-547" title="coasters2" src="http://ieatcupcakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/coasters2-e1295848377731-343x510.jpg" alt="" width="343" height="510" /></a></p>

<p>*Doesn&#8217;t everyone celebrate their half-birthday? Well, if they don&#8217;t then they are missing out! Who wouldn&#8217;t want another holiday to have as an excuse to get all your friends together all dressed up?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was the perfect day for ShojoPop night for a multitude of reasons. The first reason being that I got my new camera in the mail today! And not only that, but after many failed attempts at trying to figure out how to use my new eye-fi card with my new camera, I really needed to make something ultra-cute and candy/cupcake-esque to make myself feel better about my ineptness with technology. I think this camera case proves to the world that you don&#8217;t have to be good with technology as long as you can make cute cases for your technological items. And can I just reiterate how much I love love love things that are reversible?! Now I have a camera case that matches <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/2010/07/12/cupcake-apron/">Melissa&#8217;s apron</a>! Not only is the case itself reversible, but the pink ribbon has beads that are reversed from the order of the blue ribbon. Oh, how I love the asymmetry!</p>

<p>Thank you Eidelyn for taking the cutest pictures ever even though it&#8217;s almost midnight on a school night!!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve never owned napkin rings before because a) I rarely need a napkin because I eat so fast that by the time I realize I need one, I&#8217;m done and I just wash my hands and b) similar to reason a, I don&#8217;t do a lot of sitting at the table with my napkin in a ring because the second my butt hits the chair, I&#8217;m shoveling food into my mouth. In fact, sometimes (you can ask the people I work with for proof), I start shoveling it in before I even get to my seat while walking. That&#8217;s what a piggie I am. However, the fact that napkin rings are unnecessary hasn&#8217;t kept me from admiring other (non-piggie) people&#8217;s napkin rings and wondering if I would ever grow up and have some of my very own. I got tired of waiting for that to happen, so I just decided to make some. I may never use them. I may give them away. I may list them on <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/ShojoPop" target="_blank">etsy</a>. But at least now I can say, that I pretended to be a sophisticated-napkin-ring-owning individual for at least a week. These photos are a sad reality of how bad I am at sculpting. This is the reason that I put Jessica in charge of fondant tasks. The funniest (and when I say funniest, I really mean most symbolic of my inept sculpting ability, aka lack thereof) part of this cupcake-a-day #18 project is that unlike 99.85% of the population who improve with practice, my best napkin ring of the night was the first one I did. It actually looks like a cupcake. The second through fourth look like weird midget ice cream cones. Can you guess which one I made first?* Apparently I undergo the reverse of practice makes perfect. Which would be perfect makes practice? Ummm&#8230;I think it&#8217;s past my bedtime.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today is Chris&#8217; birthday and luckily he has a Lori in his life that makes him vegan cupcakes on his birthday. Today she used <a href="http://loveveg.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/vanilla-cupcakes/" target="_blank">this recipe</a> and stuck a marshmallow in the batter before baking and it turned out like a volcano. She didn&#8217;t use icing (which is admittedly not very cupcake-like), but the icing would have hidden the unique volcano quality. Yay for birthdays that involve vegan cupcakes!!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m usually pretty amazed at the amount of good ideas I can manage to come up with when intoxicated. Either they&#8217;re good ideas or I just think they&#8217;re really good due to my altered state. Regardless, cupcake-a-day #17 is the result of an epiphany I had at Pamela&#8217;s cocktail party on New Year&#8217;s Eve. Being the classy bunch that we are, we were sipping our fancy cocktails out of red plastic solo cups. The upside to red solo cups is that they hold a lot, which is always important for every new year&#8217;s eve. The downside is that after drinking the contents of one of these, you start to set your cup down and then forget which of the numerous red cups is yours. So, at the time, my first brilliant plan was for each person to write their name on their cups. So, Emily found us a black pen and we all wrote our names on our cups. However, when you have an icy beverage, the condensation on the outside of the cup turns any markings that once resembled a name into black smudges all over everyone&#8217;s hands. So, at this point, we are not only returned to our original issue, but we now all have dirty hands..haha. Luckily we were on drink 2 or 5 at this point and so it didn&#8217;t really matter. But that&#8217;s when I came up with my brilliant solution. Solo cup cozies! I decided that for Pam&#8217;s next birthday, she&#8217;s getting a set of solo cup cozies so that at our next cocktail soiree, each guest will have their own personalized cup. Tonight I made the first one in the set which is (surprise!) cupcake themed. This was also my first journey into the realm of installing snaps. I only wasted about half the package, but I&#8217;m basically a professional now. You can tell by the asymmetry. Only professionals can do that. It&#8217;s true. Look it up. But look at these pretty pictures first and hopefully their beauty will help you forget what you were gonna look up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Chris and Evelyn love us so much that they sent us 2 boxes of chick-o-sticks! This is basically a lifetime supply of chick-o-sticks for an average family of bears, but luckily, I am a very creative bear. This is where the invention of butterfinger cupcakes came from. The world will have Chris and Evelyn to thank for <a href="http://ieatcupcakes.com/butterfinger-cupcakes-recipe/">this recipe</a>.</p>

<p>I took some pictures of the process since it&#8217;s a newly invented recipe. I am normally a proponent of filling cupcake papers almost all the way so as to maximize the amount of cucpake, but in this recipe, it&#8217;s best to not overfill or the chick-o-sticks in the batter will make the cucpakes stick to the pan.</p>

<p>Isabelle was in charge of mashing the chick-o-sticks. For the ones that went into the batter, she put them into a ziplock freezer bag and used to a rolling pin to beat them like a battered spouse. My plan was to use the rolling pin to roll them into small pieces, but apparently, chick-o-sticks are harder than I thought so the rolling pin basically posed as a hammer. When it was time to make the icing, I brought up the idea of using the mortar and pestle to pulverize the sticks into a fine dust. That was a much quieter method. I suggest that one for the future. I also considered a food processor, but never made it that far. Maybe next time&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Quantity: </strong>24 chocolate cupcakes w/ butterfinger icing</p>

<p><strong>Batter Ingredients:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>2 ½ c unbleached white flour</li>
    <li>2/3 c cocoa powder</li>
    <li>1 ½ t baking soda</li>
    <li>1 t baking powder</li>
    <li>½ t salt</li>
    <li>1 ¾ c sugar</li>
    <li>2/3 c sunflower oil</li>
    <li>2 c soymilk</li>
    <li>1 T vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 T apple cider vinegar</li>
    <li>8 chick-o-sticks (mashed into chunks)</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Icing Ingredients:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>¾ c earth balance</li>
    <li>¾ c palm shortening</li>
    <li>¼ c water or soymilk</li>
    <li>1 T vanilla extract</li>
    <li>4 ½ c powdered sugar (sifted)</li>
    <li>4 chick-o-sticks (mashed into crumbs)</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Cupcake Directions:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Preheat</strong> the oven to 350º.  Line 2 muffin pans with paper liners or set up 24 silicone wrappers on 2 baking sheets.</p>

<p><strong>Combine</strong> vinegar and soymilk and let sit.  In another bowl, sift the flour, cocoa, soda, powder, and salt.</p>

<p><strong>Add</strong> oil, sugar, and vanilla to the soymilk mixture and stir well.  Pour liquid into dry and mix until smooth. Add chunks of chick-o-sticks.</p>

<p><strong>Fill</strong> the baking cups up to 2/3 full. Do not overfill.</p>

<p><strong>Bake</strong> for 18-20 minutes, until when you insert a toothpick into the center of one, it comes out clean.</p>

<p><strong>Icing Directions:</strong></p>

<p>Using an electric mixer, whip up the first four icing ingredients, sifting in powdered sugar slowly and adding additional soymilk if it gets too thick. Add the chick-o-stick crumbs last, saving a few to sprinkle on top if interested. Pipe onto cooled cupcakes with a wide tip.  If you don’t have a piping bag, you can use a plastic bag with a hole cut in the corner.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The button on the scarf is supposed to be the cherry on the cupcake. By the way, why is it that every time we draw a cupcake, we make a cherry on top? When you examine the ratio of non-edible cupcakes with cherries to edible ones with cherries, I figure it would be something like 379562:1. Really, when is the last time you ate a cupcake with a cherry on it? I&#8217;m pretty sure I can honestly answer never.</p>
